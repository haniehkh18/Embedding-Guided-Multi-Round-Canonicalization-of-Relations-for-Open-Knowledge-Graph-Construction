0,0,"- are people not actively searching for work due to
- are people not started searching for work because of",are people not actively searching for work due to,"""People not actively seeking employment due to certain reasons""",are people not actively searching for work due to,"""People not actively seeking employment due to certain reasons""",CoT,"This label is clear and explicitly states that the reason for not seeking employment is a key part of the relationship. It also uses more general language (""seeking employment"" instead of ""searching for work"") which can encompass a wider range of scenarios. Additionally, it implies that there are specific reasons behind the lack of job search activity, which aligns with the semantic intent of the original phrases. The use of ""certain reasons"" broadens the semantic coverage to include any potential reason, making it more generally applicable than the other two options."
1,1,"- share increase expected after Dutch transition to
- share increase expected after Dutch transition from",share increase expected after Dutch transition to,"""Expected share increase after Dutch transition""",share increase expected after Dutch transition to,"""Expected share increase after Dutch transition""",CoT,"This label is chosen because it captures the essence of both phrases by omitting the specific prepositions ""to"" and ""from,"" which are context-dependent. By excluding these prepositions, the label maintains broad semantic coverage and can be applied to various contexts where the direction of the transition (to or from) is not specified. It is clear and concise, reflecting the expected outcome (share increase) after a Dutch transition without limiting the scope to a particular direction of that transition."
2,2,"- scepticism remained minority attitude in
- scepticism towards policymaking",scepticism towards policymaking,"""Scepticism towards""",scepticism remained minority attitude in,"""Scepticism towards""",CoT,"The label ""Scepticism towards"" is broad enough to encompass both the specific instance of ""scepticism towards policymaking"" and the more general idea of ""scepticism remained minority attitude in"". It captures the essence of scepticism being directed at something without being overly specific or tied to a particular context, making it more generally applicable. The other options are either too specific (CESI's ""scepticism towards policymaking"") or too verbose and context-specific (EDC's ""scepticism remained minority attitude in"")."
3,3,"- data location old scheme
- data location enhanced scheme",data location old scheme,Data location scheme,data location old scheme,Data location scheme,CoT,"The label ""Data location scheme"" chosen by CoT is the most appropriate as it encompasses both the ""old"" and ""enhanced"" schemes without specifying one over the other. It is broad enough to cover any type of data location scheme, making it more universally applicable and semantically representative of the group of phrases. The other two labels are limited by the inclusion of ""old,"" which does not account for the ""enhanced"" scheme."
4,4,"- claim pension while working
- work and claim pensions",work and claim pensions,"""Claiming pension while employed""",claim pension while working,"""Claiming pension while employed""",CoT,"The label ""Claiming pension while employed"" chosen by CoT system provides the clearest and most comprehensive description of the relationship. It explicitly states the condition of being employed while claiming a pension, which covers the semantics of both ""claim pension while working"" and ""work and claim pensions"". The use of the gerund form ""Claiming"" also implies an ongoing action, which is applicable to the general case of individuals who might be in this situation. Additionally, the term ""employed"" is more formal and universally understood than ""working"", which can imply a broader range of activities beyond formal employment."
5,5,"- suggests role as financial centres
- size in financial centres",suggests role as financial centres,Attributes of Financial Centres,suggests role as financial centres,Attributes of Financial Centres,CoT,"The label ""Attributes of Financial Centres"" is broader and more inclusive, capturing the essence of both phrases given. It suggests that the relations pertain to various characteristics or features of financial centres, which can include roles, sizes, and potentially other attributes not explicitly mentioned. The other two labels are identical and specific to the role aspect, which does not fully encompass the notion of size mentioned in the second phrase. Therefore, ""Attributes of Financial Centres"" is the most representative and general label for the group of phrases."
6,6,"- members sharing dense matrix of trade
- share a dense matrix of bilateral trade with",members sharing dense matrix of trade,"""Entities involved in dense bilateral trade""",members sharing dense matrix of trade,"""Entities involved in dense bilateral trade""",CoT,"This label is chosen because it captures the essence of the original phrases while providing a clear and general description. It uses the term ""entities"" which is broad and inclusive, covering any possible members that could be involved in trade. The phrase ""involved in dense bilateral trade"" accurately reflects the concept of a ""dense matrix of bilateral trade,"" indicating a significant level of trade activity between the entities. It also implies reciprocity, which is a key aspect of the original phrases. Overall, this label is succinct, semantically rich, and applicable to a wide range of entities that could be part of such a relationship in a knowledge graph."
7,7,"- are intermediators in
- became intermediaries in",are intermediators in,"""Serve as intermediaries in""",are intermediators in,"""Serve as intermediaries in""",CoT,"The phrase ""Serve as intermediaries in"" captures the essence of both provided phrases while also being grammatically correct and clear in its meaning. It implies the role of an entity acting as an intermediary within a process or transaction, which is a broader and more inclusive representation of the semantic concept shared by the original phrases. The use of ""serve as"" is more commonly used and understood than ""are intermediators in,"" making it more suitable for general applicability."
8,8,"- included commercial papers in
- continued trades with corporate commercial paper",included commercial papers in,Trading commercial papers,included commercial papers in,Trading commercial papers,CoT,"The label ""Trading commercial papers"" is more inclusive and representative of both phrases provided. It captures the essence of an ongoing activity involving commercial papers, which is implied by both ""included commercial papers in"" and ""continued trades with corporate commercial paper."" The term ""trading"" suggests the exchange or dealing of commercial papers, which can encompass both inclusion in a portfolio and the continuation of trades. The other two labels are more specific and do not cover the broader activity implied by ""continued trades with corporate commercial paper."""
9,9,"- euro area HICP with without OOH related
- euro area HICPX 2012 to 2020",euro area HICP with without OOH related,"""Euro area inflation-related statistics""",euro area HICP with without OOH related,"""Euro area inflation-related statistics""",CoT,"The chosen label captures the essence of both phrases by referring to inflation-related statistics in the euro area, which is the broader category under which the HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) falls. The label is clear and has broad semantic coverage, encompassing both the specific HICP data with or without owner-occupied housing (OOH) and the HICPX data from 2012 to 2020. It avoids the redundancy of the phrase ""with without OOH related"" and is more general and applicable to a wider range of related data."
10,10,"- has median return on common equity
- return on common equity hovers around",has median return on common equity,"""Measurement of Return on Common Equity""",has median return on common equity,"""Measurement of Return on Common Equity""",CoT,"The chosen label encompasses both the concept of a median value and the idea of hovering around a certain point, as it implies a measurement which can vary. It is clear and broadly covers the semantic meaning of the given phrases by focusing on the measurement aspect rather than a specific statistical metric (median). This makes it generally applicable to various contexts where the return on common equity is discussed or analyzed."
11,11,"- ECR covers
- has ECR level nearly three times of
- national ETS covers",ECR covers,"""represents in terms of system or level""",ECR covers,"""represents in terms of system or level""",CoT,"The chosen label ""represents in terms of system or level"" is the most inclusive and abstract, capturing the essence of the different phrases provided. It reflects the idea that there is a representation or equivalence in terms of a system (such as ECR or ETS) or a level (such as the ""level nearly three times of""). The other two options, ""ECR covers,"" are too specific and only accurately represent one of the given phrases, failing to encompass the broader semantic meaning implied by the other phrases."
12,12,"- roadmap includes
- has roadmap outlined by",has roadmap outlined by,"""Entity has a roadmap""",roadmap includes,"""Entity has a roadmap""",CoT,"The label ""Entity has a roadmap"" is the most general and semantically inclusive of the three options. It captures the essence of both phrases (""roadmap includes"" and ""has roadmap outlined by"") by indicating that an entity possesses a roadmap, without specifying the manner of inclusion or outlining. This label is clear, concise, and applicable to a wide range of scenarios where an entity is associated with a roadmap, making it the best choice for a canonical label."
13,13,"- transfer fraction is three times of
- transfer factor is ten times of",transfer fraction is three times of,"""Transfer quantity is a multiple of""",transfer fraction is three times of,"""Transfer quantity is a multiple of""",CoT,"The label ""Transfer quantity is a multiple of"" is the most inclusive and semantically broad of the three options. It captures the essence of both phrases, which describe a transfer amount being a multiple (three times or ten times) of another quantity. This label is clear, generalizes well to other similar relations that may involve different multiples, and avoids the specificity of the exact multiple, making it applicable to a wider range of scenarios within a knowledge graph."
14,14,"- out of housing wealth in
- out of financial wealth found as",out of housing wealth in,"""Deriving from specific forms of wealth""",out of housing wealth in,"""Deriving from specific forms of wealth""",CoT,"The chosen label encompasses both the concept of housing wealth and financial wealth, indicating a source or origin relationship that is applicable to various forms of wealth. It is more inclusive and general than the other options, which are limited to housing wealth only. The phrase ""Deriving from specific forms of wealth"" clearly communicates that there is a derivation or source relationship, which is semantically relevant to both given phrases."
15,15,"- green bonds purpose
- percentage issued as green bonds
- amount issued in green bonds",amount issued in green bonds,Green bonds issuance and purpose details,green bonds purpose,Green bonds issuance and purpose details,CoT,"This label encompasses both the financial aspect of the green bonds (issuance, amount, percentage) and the non-financial aspect (purpose). It is broad enough to cover all the given phrases semantically, providing a clear and comprehensive understanding of what the relation phrases are about. The other two labels are more narrow and only cover part of the semantic range of the phrases. ""Amount issued in green bonds"" focuses solely on the financial metric, while ""green bonds purpose"" only addresses the intent behind the bonds, leaving out the quantitative aspects."
16,16,"- hoarded
- hoard",hoarded,Accumulate secretly,hoarded,Accumulate secretly,CoT,"The phrases ""hoarded"" and ""hoard"" both imply the act of accumulating or collecting items in a secretive or careful manner, often excessively. The label ""Accumulate secretly"" captures the essence of both terms, providing a clear and broad semantic understanding of the action described by the phrases. It generalizes the concept to include the secretive aspect, which is a common connotation of hoarding behavior. This label is more descriptive and inclusive than simply using ""hoarded,"" which is a specific tense of the verb and does not by itself convey the secretive nature of the action."
17,17,"- state of in construction sector
- state of recruitment",state of recruitment,"""State of a sector/process""",state of in construction sector,"""State of a sector/process""",CoT,"This label is the most inclusive and generalizable among the options provided. It captures the essence of both phrases by referring to the ""state of"" something, which can be applied to various sectors or processes, including the construction sector and recruitment. It is clear and broad enough to encompass a wide range of similar phrases that may relate to the condition or status of different sectors or processes within a knowledge graph."
18,18,"- most acute for
- most acute at the moment",most acute for,"""Peak intensity at a specific time""",most acute for,"""Peak intensity at a specific time""",CoT,"The proposed label ""Peak intensity at a specific time"" captures the essence of both phrases, indicating not only the high level of intensity (implied by ""most acute"") but also the temporal aspect (""at the moment"" and ""for""). It is clear and provides a broad semantic coverage that is applicable to various contexts where these phrases might be used. The other two labels, ""most acute for,"" do not explicitly capture the temporal element, which is a significant part of the meaning in the given phrases."
19,19,"- is subject of public trust
- context of public trust",context of public trust,Pertains to the concept of public trust,is subject of public trust,Pertains to the concept of public trust,CoT,"The label ""Pertains to the concept of public trust"" is the most inclusive and flexible, covering both the notion of being a subject within the context of public trust and the broader context itself. It captures the essence of both phrases by indicating a relationship to the overarching idea of public trust without limiting the scope to either being a subject or the context specifically. This makes it more universally applicable to various instances that may relate to the concept of public trust in a knowledge graph."
20,20,"- has highest corporate debt
- has high corporate debt in",has highest corporate debt,Has high corporate debt,has highest corporate debt,Has high corporate debt,CoT,"The label ""Has high corporate debt"" is chosen because it is more inclusive and general than ""has highest corporate debt."" The term ""highest"" implies a superlative degree that does not accurately represent the second phrase ""has high corporate debt in,"" which suggests a high but not necessarily the highest amount of corporate debt. The chosen label maintains the semantic meaning of both phrases while providing a broader coverage that can apply to various degrees of high corporate debt without implying an absolute superlative."
21,21,"- living standards drifted away from
- living standards deteriorate less or same",living standards drifted away from,"""Deterioration or stagnation of living standards""",living standards drifted away from,"""Deterioration or stagnation of living standards""",CoT,"The chosen label encompasses the idea that living standards are either getting worse or not improving, which covers both the concept of drifting away (implying a negative change) and deteriorating less or the same (implying either a negative change or no change). It is clear and broad enough to represent the semantic meaning of both phrases provided."
22,22,"- exemption profit margin criterion
- profit margin criterion less than",exemption profit margin criterion,Profit Margin Threshold Criterion,exemption profit margin criterion,Profit Margin Threshold Criterion,CoT,"The term ""Threshold"" broadly encompasses the idea of a criterion that could be an exemption or a specific value that should not be exceeded (less than). It is more inclusive and generic than specifying ""exemption,"" which is only one type of criterion. The label ""Profit Margin Threshold Criterion"" is clear and can be generally applied to various scenarios where a profit margin criterion is used, whether it's an exemption or a limit."
23,23,"- paves way for
- paves the way for",paves way for,Paves the way for,paves way for,Paves the way for,CoT,"The phrase ""Paves the way for"" is grammatically complete and includes the definite article ""the,"" which is commonly used in this expression. This version is more formal and is likely to be recognized and understood in a wide range of contexts, ensuring broad semantic coverage and general applicability. The capitalization of the first word is a stylistic choice that does not significantly affect the meaning, but it does make the label stand out as a proper title or concept, which can be helpful in the context of a knowledge graph where such phrases are often treated as labels for relationships."
24,24,"- implied by latest forward curve
- forward curve",implied by latest forward curve,Forward Curve Interpretation,implied by latest forward curve,Forward Curve Interpretation,CoT,"The label ""Forward Curve Interpretation"" is broad enough to encompass both the specific phrase ""implied by latest forward curve"" and the more general ""forward curve."" It suggests a broader category that includes various interpretations or analyses related to the forward curve, which is a financial term referring to the expected future prices of a commodity, security, or currency as determined by the forward market. The other two labels are identical and too specific, as they only represent the phrase ""implied by latest forward curve"" without acknowledging the more general ""forward curve"" phrase. Therefore, ""Forward Curve Interpretation"" is the most suitable label as it captures the essence of both phrases and can be applied more generally."
25,25,"- had carbon tax since
- sets carbon price in",had carbon tax since,Implements carbon pricing mechanism,had carbon tax since,Implements carbon pricing mechanism,CoT,"The chosen label ""Implements carbon pricing mechanism"" captures the essence of both phrases ""had carbon tax since"" and ""sets carbon price in"" by encompassing the broader concept of a carbon pricing mechanism, which can include both a carbon tax and a carbon price. It is clear and has the broadest semantic coverage, making it generally applicable to various instances where a carbon pricing strategy is applied."
26,26,"- time when subsidies and capital injections exceeded
- cause for subsidies and capital injections to exceed",time when subsidies and capital injections exceeded,"""Circumstances leading to subsidies and capital injections exceeding""",time when subsidies and capital injections exceeded,"""Circumstances leading to subsidies and capital injections exceeding""",CoT,"This label encompasses both the aspect of timing and causality implied in the original phrases. It is broad enough to cover various scenarios that could lead to the exceeding of subsidies and capital injections, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relation. The other two labels focus solely on the timing aspect and do not capture the causative element present in the second phrase."
27,27,"- paralysed
- has paralysed
- paralyzed",paralysed,Paralyzed,paralysed,Paralyzed,CoT,"The label ""Paralyzed"" is chosen as it represents the most commonly used spelling in American English, which is widely used in scientific and international contexts. It also captures the essence of the relation phrases with clarity and broad semantic coverage. The verb form is more general and applicable than the phrase ""has paralysed,"" which is more specific and may not cover all possible uses of the term in a knowledge graph. Additionally, the capitalized form is not necessary, but it does not detract from its applicability."
28,28,"- mindful about
- mindful due to",mindful about,Being mindful of,mindful about,Being mindful of,CoT,"The label ""Being mindful of"" encompasses both ""mindful about"" and ""mindful due to,"" as it implies an awareness or consideration that could be prompted by various reasons or contexts. It has a broad semantic coverage and can be generally applied to situations where mindfulness is due to a specific cause or simply about a particular subject. The preposition ""of"" is more inclusive and can substitute for both ""about"" and ""due to"" in this context, making it a more flexible and representative choice for canonical labeling."
29,29,"- with ICL size
- receives ICL from
- related to ICL",related to ICL,'Interacts with ICL',with ICL size,"""Interacts with ICL""",CoT,"The label ""Interacts with ICL"" encompasses a broad range of interactions that could include receiving ICL, having a relation to ICL, or the size of ICL, which could imply a measurement or assessment of interaction. It is a more inclusive term that can cover various types of relationships with ICL, making it a suitable canonical label for the given phrases. The other options are more specific and do not capture the full range of potential interactions that ""Interacts with ICL"" does."
30,30,"- of ICPFs in 2016
- of ICPFs by end of 2022",of ICPFs by end of 2022,"""of ICPFs in [time period]""",of ICPFs in 2016,"""of ICPFs in [time period]""",CoT,"The label proposed by CoT, ""of ICPFs in [time period],"" is the most inclusive and generalizable of the three options. It captures the essence of the relation phrases, which is that they are describing something related to ICPFs within a specific time frame. By using ""[time period]"" as a placeholder, this label can be applied to any specific year or range of years, making it semantically broad and applicable to various time-related contexts within the knowledge graph. The other two labels are tied to specific years and do not offer the same level of general applicability."
31,31,"- has wage indexation system
- has percentage of employees under indexation system",has percentage of employees under indexation system,"""Has employees under wage indexation system""",has wage indexation system,"""has wage indexation system""",EDC,"The label ""has wage indexation system"" is the most broadly applicable and semantically inclusive option for representing the given phrases. It covers the concept of a wage indexation system existing within an entity without specifying the details of how many or what percentage of employees are under this system, making it a more general and universally applicable label. The other labels are more specific and exclude scenarios where the percentage may not be relevant or where the focus is on the existence of the system itself rather than the details of its implementation."
32,32,"- responsibility for AML tasks should be in
- should be given responsibility for AML tasks",responsibility for AML tasks should be in,"""Responsibility for AML tasks should be assigned to""",responsibility for AML tasks should be in,"""Responsibility for AML tasks should be assigned to""",CoT,"The chosen label ""Responsibility for AML tasks should be assigned to"" encompasses the meaning of both given phrases by implying an action of assignment, which is a necessary implication for responsibility to be given or held. It also maintains clarity and general applicability by specifying that there is an active assignment of responsibility, which covers scenarios where responsibility is being designated to a particular party. The other two labels, while similar, lack the explicit action of assignment, which could be interpreted as a static state rather than a dynamic action."
33,33,"- adjusts number of recipients based on
- assumes constant number of recipients at",adjusts number of recipients based on,"""Regulates the quantity of recipients""",adjusts number of recipients based on,"""Regulates the quantity of recipients""",CoT,"The label ""Regulates the quantity of recipients"" is chosen because it encompasses the idea of both adjusting and assuming a number of recipients, which are actions that involve regulation. The term ""regulates"" is broad enough to cover various scenarios where the number of recipients may change or remain constant, thus providing a more general and semantically inclusive label for the given phrases. The other two options are identical and are more specific to the action of adjusting, which does not fully capture the concept of assuming a constant number. Therefore, ""Regulates the quantity of recipients"" is the most appropriate label for its clarity and broad semantic coverage."
34,34,"- effective in damping employment losses compared to
- no employment losses during",effective in damping employment losses compared to,Employment losses management,effective in damping employment losses compared to,Employment losses management,CoT,"The label ""Employment losses management"" is broader and more inclusive, capturing the essence of both phrases provided. It implies a general approach or effectiveness in handling employment losses, which can encompass both the prevention of losses and the mitigation of their impact. The other two labels are identical and too specific, as they only reflect the concept of effectiveness in damping losses, without covering the scenario where there are no losses during a certain period."
35,35,"- to decarbonise
- help to decarbonise",help to decarbonise,To decarbonise,to decarbonise,to decarbonise,EDC,"The label ""to decarbonise"" is clear and has broad semantic coverage, as it encompasses the action of decarbonisation without specifying the manner or assistance, which makes it generally applicable to various contexts. The phrase ""help to decarbonise"" can be considered a specific instance of the broader action ""to decarbonise."" Therefore, the label ""to decarbonise"" is the most inclusive and representative of the given phrases. The capitalisation in ""To decarbonise"" from CoT is not necessary as labels are typically presented in lowercase unless they are proper nouns or acronyms."
36,36,"- weak investment sentiment may be caused by
- time of investment sentiment deterioration",weak investment sentiment may be caused by,"""Deterioration and causes of weak investment sentiment""",weak investment sentiment may be caused by,"""Deterioration and causes of weak investment sentiment""",CoT,"The chosen label encompasses both aspects of the relation phrases: the deterioration of investment sentiment and the potential causes behind it. It is broader and more inclusive than the other two options, which only focus on the causality aspect. The label ""Deterioration and causes of weak investment sentiment"" also implies a temporal element (""time of"") and a causal relationship (""may be caused by""), thus covering the semantic range of both phrases effectively."
37,37,"- R04
- R4",R4,R04,R04,R04,CoT,"The label ""R04"" is chosen because it includes a leading zero, which suggests a standardized format that could potentially accommodate a larger range of numerically indexed relations (e.g., R01, R02, R03, etc.). This format implies a more formal or systematic approach to labeling, which may be beneficial for consistency and sorting purposes within a knowledge graph. Both ""CoT"" and ""EDC"" systems have proposed ""R04"" as the canonical label, indicating a consensus that may reflect broader acceptance of this format."
38,38,"- R11
- R10",R11,,R11,R11,CESI,"Given that ""R11"" and ""R10"" are semantically similar, and two out of the three systems (CESI and EDC) have chosen ""R11"" as the canonical label, it seems to be the most representative. ""nan"" from CoT is not informative as it typically stands for ""not a number"" and does not provide any semantic information about the relationship. Therefore, ""R11"" is chosen for its clarity and because it has been agreed upon by the majority of the systems."
39,39,"- R5
- R05",R5,R5,R5,R5,CoT,"All three systems have proposed the same label ""R5,"" which suggests a consensus on the most representative label for the given phrases. The label ""R5"" is clear, concise, and directly reflects the given phrases ""R5"" and ""R05,"" where ""R05"" can be seen as a zero-padded version of ""R5."" The chosen label has broad semantic coverage as it captures the essence of both phrases without unnecessary complexity or specificity. It is also generally applicable as it does not include any additional characters or formatting that could limit its use in different contexts."
40,40,"- R1
- R01",R01,Sequential Alphanumeric Code,R1,Sequential Alphanumeric Code,CoT,"The label ""Sequential Alphanumeric Code"" is the most descriptive and inclusive, as it captures the essence of both ""R1"" and ""R01"" by indicating that the relation phrases are part of a series that includes both letters and numbers. It is clear and provides a broad semantic coverage that can apply to similar patterns beyond just the two examples given. Both ""R1"" and ""R01"" can be seen as instances of such a code, whereas the labels ""R1"" and ""R01"" are too specific and exclude each other."
41,41,"- R9
- R09",R9,R9,R9,R9,EDC,"Both given phrases ""R9"" and ""R09"" are semantically similar and represent the same concept. The leading zero in ""R09"" does not add any semantic value and can be considered a formatting variation. All three systems propose ""R9"" as the canonical label, which is clear, concise, and broadly applicable, capturing the essence of the relation without unnecessary detail. Therefore, ""R9"" is the best label to represent the group of phrases."
42,42,"- R19
- R18
- R20",R19,,R19,R19,EDC,"Given that both EDC and CESI systems propose ""R19"" as the canonical label for the group of semantically similar relation phrases, it suggests a consensus on this label being representative of the phrases R19, R18, and R20. The label ""R19"" seems to be chosen for its clarity and possibly its central position within the range of the given phrases. The CoT system's suggestion of ""nan"" (which typically stands for 'not a number' or 'not applicable') does not provide any semantic information and therefore is not a useful label for the group of relation phrases. Hence, ""R19"" is the best label as it is clear and has been agreed upon by multiple systems, indicating its suitability to represent the group semantically."
43,43,"- R2
- R02",R2,"""R2/R02""",R2,"""R2""",EDC,"The label ""R2"" is concise, clear, and directly reflects the content of both given phrases, ""R2"" and ""R02"". The leading zero in ""R02"" does not change the semantic meaning of the relation and is likely a formatting variation. Therefore, ""R2"" is the most appropriate label as it captures the essence of the relation without unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. Both EDC and CESI systems proposed this label, indicating a consensus on its suitability."
44,44,"- R03
- R3",R03,R3,R03,R03,EDC,"The label ""R03"" includes a leading zero, which suggests a standardized format that could potentially accommodate a larger range of numbers (e.g., R01, R02, R03, ..., R10, R11, etc.). This format is more explicit and may imply a fixed-width numbering system, which can be beneficial for sorting and organizing purposes. Since two out of the three systems proposed ""R03"" as the canonical label, it also indicates a consensus among the systems, which supports the choice of ""R03"" for clarity and consistency in the knowledge graph."
45,45,"- R8
- R08",R8,R8,R8,R8,CoT,"All three systems have proposed the same canonical label ""R8"" which suggests a consensus on the representation of the relation phrases. The label ""R8"" is clear, concise, and seems to cover the semantic meaning of both given phrases (""R8"" and ""R08"") adequately, as the leading zero in ""R08"" does not change the semantic meaning and is likely just a formatting variation. Therefore, ""R8"" is the best label to represent the group of semantically similar relation phrases."
46,46,"- R14
- R15
- R17
- R16",R16,This would involve choosing the final label from the proposed labels. This could involve weighing the pros and cons of each label and choosing the one that best represents the phrases in the cluster.,R14,R16,CESI,"Without additional context or understanding of what the labels R14, R15, R16, and R17 specifically refer to, it is impossible to make an informed decision based on semantic coverage or applicability. However, since CESI proposed ""R16"" as the canonical label, and given that the labels are numerically consecutive, it is reasonable to assume that ""R16"" might be centrally located within the range and could potentially represent the midpoint or average of the group. Therefore, in the absence of further information, ""R16"" is selected, but it should be noted that this choice is arbitrary and assumes CESI's proposal has some unspecified rationale that justifies it as the best representative label."
47,47,"- R13
- R12",R12,,R13,"""R12""",CESI,"Given that the two phrases are ""R13"" and ""R12,"" and without additional context, it is impossible to determine the semantic meaning behind these codes. However, since both are numerical and sequential, it is reasonable to assume that they are part of a series and are likely to be closely related. Choosing ""R12"" as the canonical label is arbitrary but just as valid as choosing ""R13,"" given the lack of context. The label ""nan"" from CoT is not selected because it typically represents a ""not a number"" value, which does not provide any semantic information about the relationship. Therefore, ""R12"" is chosen for its equal relevance and representation of the given phrases."
48,48,"- R7
- R07",R7,"""R7""",R7,"""R7""",CoT,"All three systems suggest essentially the same label, with the only difference being the inclusion of quotation marks in the CoT system. Since the phrases ""R7"" and ""R07"" are numerically identical and the leading zero in ""R07"" does not change the semantic meaning, the label ""R7"" is clear and accurately represents both phrases without unnecessary punctuation. It has broad semantic coverage and general applicability as it directly reflects the content of the phrases without additional formatting."
49,49,"- R06
- R6",R6,R6,R06,R6,CoT,"The label ""R6"" is a more generalized representation of the given phrases ""R06"" and ""R6"". It covers both variations by omitting the leading zero, which is often used as a placeholder and does not typically alter the semantic meaning of the identifier. Therefore, ""R6"" is clearer and has broader applicability across different contexts where the leading zero may or may not be present."
50,50,"- cash infrastructure issues mentioned
- cash infrastructure has deteriorated",cash infrastructure issues mentioned,Cash infrastructure issues,cash infrastructure issues mentioned,Cash infrastructure issues,CoT,"The label ""Cash infrastructure issues"" chosen from CoT is broad enough to encompass both specific phrases ""cash infrastructure issues mentioned"" and ""cash infrastructure has deteriorated."" It captures the essence of both phrases without being too specific to one particular instance (as in the case of ""cash infrastructure issues mentioned"") or too vague.

It is clear and explicitly includes the temporal aspect, which is implied in the phrases ""in"" and ""during."" This label is also broad enough to encompass the notion of ""withdrawal of"" by implying that the withdrawals are associated with a specific period, which could be when the withdrawal occurred. The use of ""during a specific period"" makes it universally applicable to any time-related context, thus providing the most comprehensive semantic coverage."

104,104,"- both trusts
- trusts",both trusts,Trusts,both trusts,Trusts,CoT,"The label ""Trusts"" is more inclusive and broadly applicable as it captures the essence of the relationship without specifying the number of entities involved. The word ""both"" in ""both trusts"" implies a mutual relationship between two entities specifically, which may not always be the case or necessary to express in a canonical label.

It indicates that an entity is providing an opinion, which is the core action described by each of the original phrases. The term ""expresses"" is more broadly applicable than ""on"" or ""about,"" which are prepositions that could imply a more limited context.

It implies a lack of certainty or assurance in the mapping process, which is a common theme across all the original phrases. ""Cannot assure precise mapping to"" is slightly more specific by including ""precise,"" which may not be applicable in all cases.

It is succinct and directly captures the essence of a resolution being attributed to a source. ""Resolution process"" is a broader term that could imply the entire process of resolution rather than the specific relationship between the resolver and the resolved issue. ""In resolution of"" is more passive and less direct than ""resolved by,"" making it slightly less clear in indicating the agent responsible for the resolution.

- unwound in",unwound in,Unfold over time,unfold in,Unfold over time,CoT,"The chosen label ""Unfold over time"" captures the essence of the phrases provided, as each one implies a process or event that occurs or is revealed progressively over a period of time. The word ""unfold"" is common to most of the phrases and is indicative of this gradual process.

It provides broad semantic coverage and is applicable in a wider range of contexts. The label ""left in"" is more specific and may not always be applicable when the simpler action ""left"" is intended. The capitalization in ""Left"" provided by CoT is unnecessary as relation labels are typically lowercase to maintain consistency and avoid case-sensitivity issues. Therefore, ""left"" is the most clear and generally applicable label."
118,118,"- leading issuer of
- main issuer and holder of",leading issuer of,Primary issuer of,leading issuer of,Primary issuer of,CoT,"The term ""primary"" is more inclusive and broadly applicable than ""leading,"" as it encompasses the notion of being the main or principal issuer without necessarily implying a competitive or hierarchical aspect that ""leading"" might connote. ""Primary issuer of"" can cover both ""leading issuer of"" and ""main issuer and holder of,"" as it suggests the entity is the foremost issuer, which could also imply that they hold a significant position, without limiting the phrase to a competitive context.

- monthly flows close to zero since",monthly flows close to zero since,"""Monthly flows status since""",monthly flows negative since,"""Monthly flows status since""",CoT,"The label ""Monthly flows status since"" is the most inclusive and general of the three options. It encompasses both the concept of flows being negative and being close to zero, as well as any other potential status the monthly flows might have. It provides a broad semantic coverage that can apply to various situations regarding the status of monthly flows over time, without being too specific to only one condition. This makes it the most suitable canonical label for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."

- indebtedness increase by
- increase of net lending to",increase of net borrowing to,"""Increase in borrowing and lending""",increase of net borrowing to,"""Increase in borrowing and lending""",CoT,"This label encompasses both aspects of borrowing and lending mentioned in the given phrases, thus providing broad semantic coverage. It captures the essence of an increase in indebtedness (borrowing) and also includes lending, which is mentioned in one of the phrases. The use of ""and"" indicates that it is inclusive of both activities, making it more general and applicable to all the phrases. The other two labels are more specific and do not account for the lending aspect as effectively."

- factor 2
- factor 1",factor 2,Numerical Factor,factor 3,Numerical Factor,CoT,"The label ""Numerical Factor"" is the most appropriate as it captures the essence of all the given phrases, which are variations of ""factor"" with different numerical identifiers. It is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to all instances of ""factor"" followed by a number. The labels ""factor 3"" and ""factor 2"" are too specific and do not encompass all the given phrases."
157,157,"- compares profitability
- profitability comparable to pre",profitability comparable to pre,Comparing Profitability,compares profitability,compares profitability,EDC,"The label ""compares profitability"" is clear, concise, and directly captures the essence of the activity implied by all the phrases, which is the act of comparing profitability. It is broad enough to encompass both specific instances (like comparing to a previous period) and general comparisons. It is also in a verb form, which is appropriate for representing a relation or action in a knowledge graph. The other options are either too specific (""profitability comparable to pre"") or less clear in their verb form (""Comparing Profitability"" could be interpreted as a gerund or a continuous tense, which might not be as universally applicable)."
158,158,"- disregarded in
- disregards
- ignores",disregards,Ignores,disregarded in,Ignores,CoT,"The label ""Ignores"" is the most clear and broadly applicable term that captures the essence of all the given phrases. It is in present tense, which makes it more generally applicable to different contexts, and it is also the most concise. The term is widely understood and encompasses the act of disregarding or not considering something, which is the common theme across all the phrases."
159,159,"- is unprecedented in
- unprecedented in",unprecedented in,"""is unprecedented in""",is unprecedented in,"""is unprecedented in""",CoT,"The inclusion of the verb ""is"" in the phrase ""is unprecedented in"" provides a clearer and more grammatically complete structure, which can be more broadly applicable for constructing sentences in a knowledge graph. It implies an active state or condition, which is useful for expressing relationships in a knowledge graph. Both phrases provided include the verb ""is,"" indicating that it is a common element and important for the intended meaning. Therefore, ""is unprecedented in"" is the best label as it captures the full semantic intent of the given phrases."

It is a general term that can be used to represent various types of connections or relationships, which is implied by each of the original phrases. The other two options, ""linkages in"" and ""interlinkages help understand,"" are more specific and include additional context that may not be applicable to all instances of the relation. Therefore, ""Linkages"" is the best choice for a canonical label that captures the essence of the relation phrases while maintaining generality and clarity."
161,161,"- in the global economy is
- position in global economy",in the global economy is,Position in the global economy,in the global economy is,Position in the global economy,CoT,"The phrase ""Position in the global economy"" is more inclusive and representative of the given relation phrases. It captures the notion of a status or role within the global economic context, which can be applied to various entities such as countries, corporations, or other economic actors. The phrase is clear, and its noun form (""Position"") implies a state or condition that can be described or measured, which is generally what a knowledge graph aims to represent. The other candidate, ""in the global economy is,"" is less clear because it is a fragment of a sentence and does not stand alone as well as ""Position in the global economy."""

It is clear and maintains the essential meaning of comparison between entities, which is a key aspect of the original phrases. The phrase ""has higher and more volatile expectations since"" also implies a comparison, although it suggests a temporal aspect. However, the chosen label is broad enough to encompass the temporal comparison without explicitly stating it, making it generally applicable to various contexts where the comparison is being made. The label proposed by CoT adds ""in comparison,"" which is redundant since the word ""than"" already implies a comparison and does not add significant semantic value to the label."
163,163,"- stopped financing
- stop financing timeline",stopped financing,Cease Financing,stopped financing,Cease Financing,CoT,"The label ""Cease Financing"" is chosen because it encompasses the action of stopping the financing in a broad and clear manner. It covers both past (stopped) and ongoing or future intentions (stop) to halt financing activities. The term ""cease"" is a formal and general term that can be applied to various contexts within a knowledge graph, making it semantically rich and widely applicable. The phrase ""stop financing timeline"" suggests a broader action than just ""stopped financing,"" which is more specific to a past event, and ""Cease Financing"" can effectively represent the discontinuation of financing over a timeline as well."
164,164,"- retrace due to
- retract as",retract as,Withdraw because of,retrace due to,Withdraw because of,CoT,"The label ""Withdraw because of"" encompasses the idea of pulling back or taking something back due to a reason, which is a common thread between the phrases ""retrace due to"" and ""retract as."" It captures the essence of a causal relationship that prompts a withdrawal action, which is semantically consistent with both given phrases. The other options are less inclusive: ""retrace due to"" is too specific and doesn't necessarily imply a withdrawal, while ""retract as"" doesn't explicitly convey the causal element. ""Withdraw because of"" is clear, broad in semantic coverage, and generally applicable to situations where something is being pulled back or reversed due to a particular cause."

It also covers the geographical aspect of being ""in the euro area"" or ""at the euro area level."" The other two options, ""described in euro area as"" and ""in euro area,"" are too specific or narrow to represent all the given phrases adequately. ""Related to the Euro area"" is clear and applicable to all the phrases, making it the best choice."

It is broad enough to encompass the idea of being a focus of other studies (as they encourage further research) and directly states the support for additional research, which aligns with the second phrase. This label is clear, semantically inclusive, and can be generally applied to situations where one study leads to or supports the continuation of research in the field."
167,167,"- causes unequal benefit from
- unequal impact on",causes unequal benefit from,"""Leads to unequal impact""",causes unequal benefit from,"""Leads to unequal impact""",CoT,"The chosen label ""Leads to unequal impact"" encompasses the idea that there is an unequal effect or consequence, which can be interpreted as either an impact or a benefit. It is broad enough to cover both ""causes unequal benefit from"" and ""unequal impact on,"" as both phrases imply a directional effect that results in inequality. The term ""leads to"" is a more general verb than ""causes,"" which allows for a wider range of scenarios where the inequality might not be a direct cause but still a result. Additionally, ""impact"" is a more inclusive term that can refer to both positive and negative outcomes, similar to ""benefit,"" but also extends to other forms of effects that might not be considered beneficial."

It is clear and broadly applicable to various contexts where credit flow is being aided, without being tied to the specific preposition ""to,"" which may not always be relevant. This makes it a more general and semantically inclusive label."
170,170,"- materialized to
- materialized from",materialized to,Process of Materialization,materialized to,Process of Materialization,CoT,"The phrase ""Process of Materialization"" encompasses both the action of coming into being (""materialized to"") and the source from which something is materialized (""materialized from""). It captures the broader process involved in both directions (to and from), whereas ""materialized to"" only captures one direction of the process. Therefore, ""Process of Materialization"" offers the most clarity and broad semantic coverage for representing the given relation phrases."

This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage as it doesn't restrict the event to a specific month, and is generally applicable to various scenarios where a milestone is reached within a month. The other two labels are too specific, as they mention a particular month, which doesn't encompass all the given phrases."

It is clear and directly captures the advisory nature of the relationship, which is applicable to both ""recommended adoption of"" and ""needs to take steps for adoption of."" While ""recommended adoption of"" is also a good fit, ""Advises adoption of"" is slightly more inclusive as it can also imply the need to take steps, not just the recommendation itself."

It is broad enough to cover variations in the semantic meaning of the given phrases, as it includes both the notion of comparison and a specific level or state. The other two options are limited to the comparison aspect and do not adequately represent the phrase ""value of mobilised collateral at,"" which suggests a specific value rather than a comparison."

It captures the essence of something causing or accelerating change without the additional specificity of time or intention, making it generally applicable across various contexts. The other options either add unnecessary words (""Acts as catalyst for"") or are redundant since both EDC and CESI suggest the same label."

It implies both performance and resilience, as suggested by the phrases ""sector with strongest investment sentiment"" and ""sector held up better in investment sentiment."" The term ""strongest"" encompasses both the concept of performing best and holding up well, making it broadly applicable and semantically inclusive. Additionally, the label is clear and straightforward, avoiding any potential ambiguity that might arise from terms like ""performing best,"" which could imply a dynamic or temporal aspect not necessarily inherent in the concept of sentiment."

It is clear and has broad semantic coverage, as it implies a set or span of maturity dates, which can be applicable in various contexts where maturity details are discussed. The other two labels, ""for maturities of,"" are more restrictive and seem to apply to a specific point or instance of maturity rather than a range."

- Market State Time",Market State Time,Market Condition at a Specific Time,Market State,Market State Time,CESI,"The label ""Market State Time"" encompasses both the concept of the ""Market State"" and the temporal aspect indicated by ""Market State Time."" It is broad enough to cover both phrases, implying that it refers to the state of the market at a particular moment. ""Market Condition at a Specific Time"" is also a good representation, but it is longer and less concise. ""Market State"" alone misses the temporal dimension that is present in one of the phrases. Therefore, ""Market State Time"" strikes a balance between clarity and semantic coverage, making it the best choice to represent all the given relation phrases."

It is clear and has a broad semantic coverage that can apply to various contexts where one is keeping track of performance, progress, or achievements. The phrases ""on track for,"" ""track record in,"" and ""on track in"" all imply a sense of evaluation or observation of progress, which is aptly summarized by the label ""Monitoring Progress."" The other two proposed labels, ""on track for"" and ""on track in,"" are more specific and may not fully capture the essence of ""track record in.""

It avoids specific temporal references such as ""start"" or ""end,"" which may not apply to all instances of the relation, and it also omits the action ""saw,"" which is more specific and may not be necessary to describe the general concept of the increase in backlogs. This label retains the key elements of the relation phrases: the increase in backlogs and the notion that the increase is substantial (""greater"")."

It uses a singular form ""industry"" which is more general and can be applied broadly, and it places the emphasis on the ""significant increase"" which is the core action affecting the ""backlogs."" The label also avoids prepositions like ""in"" or ""with,"" which can be superfluous in a canonical label, making it more streamlined and adaptable for various knowledge graph applications."

184,184,"- underlies
- underlie",underlie,To be the underlying cause of,underlies,underlie,CESI,"The label ""underlie"" is the base form of the verb, which generally represents the action in its most general and broadly applicable form. It is grammatically parallel to both ""underlies"" and ""underlie,"" covering singular and plural subjects without being tied to a specific tense or aspect. This makes it the most flexible and semantically inclusive option for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph. The label ""To be the underlying cause of"" provided by CoT is more descriptive but also more verbose and specific, which might not be as universally applicable. The EDC label ""underlies"" is limited to the third-person singular present tense, which is less inclusive than the base form."

- has underpinned",underpinned,"""is underpinned by""",underpinning,"""is underpinned by""",CoT,"The label ""is underpinned by"" is the best choice as it clearly indicates a passive construction, which is common to all the given phrases. It implies a relationship where something is supported or substantiated by something else, which is the core meaning shared across all variations. This label is also in the present tense, which makes it generally applicable to different contexts, and the inclusion of ""by"" helps in understanding the directionality of the relationship in a knowledge graph."

It is more inclusive than the other two options, which are specific to the United States and do not account for the United Kingdom or any other country. The use of the placeholder ""[Country]"" indicates that the relation can be instantiated with any country's name, making it universally applicable."

While ""captures fluctuations in"" and ""showed fluctuations"" both imply the act of observing or recording changes, ""monitors"" broadens this notion to include the ongoing process of watching and checking for changes over a period of time, which could be implied in both original phrases. This makes it more inclusive and representative of the semantic similarity between the two, providing a clear and generalizable term that can be applicable in various contexts within a knowledge graph."

It covers the dynamics of policy shocks without specifying whether they are unexpected or anticipated, thus providing broad semantic coverage for the group of phrases. The terms ""unexpected"" and ""anticipates"" are specific aspects of the broader concept of policy shocks dynamics, making this label the most suitable for representing all the given relation phrases."
192,192,"- is gradual and ongoing in
- reason for gradual process",reason for gradual process,"""is a continuous and gradual process in""",is gradual and ongoing in,"""is gradual and ongoing in""",EDC,"The chosen label ""is gradual and ongoing in"" captures the essence of both phrases by emphasizing the gradual nature of the process and its ongoing status. It maintains the structure of the first phrase while also being applicable to the context implied by the second phrase. The label proposed by CoT, ""is a continuous and gradual process in,"" adds the term ""continuous,"" which is not present in the original phrases and might slightly alter the meaning. The label proposed by CESI, ""reason for gradual process,"" shifts the focus to causality, which does not encompass the full meaning of the first phrase. Therefore, ""is gradual and ongoing in"" is the most representative and inclusive label for the given phrases."

194,194,"- draws on
- draw on",draw on,Draw on,draws on,"""draw on""",CESI,"The label ""draw on"" is in the base form of the verb, which is typically used to represent the canonical form of actions or relations in a knowledge graph. It covers both the singular (""draws on"") and the plural or imperative form (""draw on"") without implying a specific subject or tense. This makes it more generally applicable and semantically inclusive of the variations provided.

It clearly indicates a causal relationship, which is the common thread between the phrases. The word ""due to"" in the other two candidate labels suggests a more passive construction, which might not be as broadly applicable to all situations where one thing actively causes turmoil in another.

It captures the essence of both ""shifted monetary policy from"" and ""shifted monetary policy to"" without implying a specific direction of the change.

It is broad enough to cover any kind of change, whether it is an increase or a decrease, thus providing a clear and general representation of the semantic similarity between the two phrases. The other two labels are biased towards one specific direction of change and do not capture the full semantic range of the original phrases."

It captures the essence that something is part of the balance sheet, which is a common way to express the relationship between balance sheet entries and the balance sheet itself. Both ""balance sheet included in"" and ""has on balance sheet"" suggest that an item is listed or recorded on the balance sheet, and this label encompasses that relationship in a way that is easily understood and semantically accurate. The other two candidate labels are less clear in their representation of the relationship as they could imply a directional inclusion rather than the fact of being an item on the balance sheet."

It is also the simplest form of the verb that captures the essence of all the given phrases without any additional context or constraints. It is broad enough to cover the semantic meaning of ""accepts,"" ""accepting only,"" and ""includes acceptance of,"" ensuring general applicability across different instances where these phrases might be used. Both CESI and EDC proposed this label, and it aligns with the criteria specified."
205,205,"- advocates for
- advocates using",advocates for,Advocates,advocates for,advocates for,EDC,"The label ""advocates for"" maintains the preposition ""for,"" which is important for capturing the full semantic meaning of the original phrases. Both ""advocates for"" and ""advocates using"" imply a direction or object of advocacy, which is preserved in the phrase ""advocates for."" The label ""Advocates"" proposed by CoT is less specific and could potentially refer to the entity doing the advocating rather than the relationship between the advocate and their cause or method. Therefore, ""advocates for"" is the best choice as it is more descriptive and maintains the intent present in both original phrases."
206,206,"- resort to
- resorted to",resort to,Resort to,resort to,"""resort to""",CoT,"The label ""resort to"" is in lowercase, which is generally preferred for consistency in knowledge graphs and databases. It is also the base form of the verb, which makes it applicable to different tenses and grammatical structures. Both ""Resort to"" and ""resorted to"" can be considered variations of the base form ""resort to,"" making it the most inclusive and representative label for the given phrases. The choice is not based on the order of the systems but on the clarity and general applicability of the label."

- masks",masked,'Masking',masking,"""masking""",EDC,"The label ""masking"" is the most appropriate choice as it represents the action in its gerund form, which is generally more inclusive and can cover various tenses and aspects of the action. It is clear and has broad semantic coverage, encompassing the act of masking whether it is currently happening, has happened, or will happen. The label ""masked"" is past tense and thus less representative of the ongoing or future actions. The label ""'Masking'"" from CoT is essentially the same as EDC's ""masking"" but includes unnecessary quotation marks, which could imply a citation or a special use case rather than a canonical label. Therefore, ""masking"" is the most general and applicable label for the given phrases."

It uses the word ""boosts"" as a more general term that can encompass ""contributes to upturn,"" thereby covering the semantic meaning of both original phrases. Additionally, it combines both aspects (employment rate and work hours) into one coherent label, making it broadly applicable and clear in its representation of the relationship described by the original phrases."

""Justifies"" could be seen as a broader term that might not capture the legal or formal implication that ""warrants"" or ""warranted for"" could have in certain contexts. Since ""warrants"" is also suggested by two out of the three systems, it indicates a consensus that this label is appropriate and has general applicability."

It is clear and directly applicable to the context implied by the phrases. ""Ceases to be based on"" introduces a different tense and suggests an immediate cessation, which may not accurately represent the ongoing or future-oriented nature of the change implied by the original phrases. Therefore, the label ""will no longer be based on"" is the best choice for its clarity and direct semantic alignment with the given phrases."
218,218,"- specialised in
- not specialised in",specialised in,Area of Specialization,specialised in,Area of Specialization,CoT,"The label ""Area of Specialization"" is the most clear and broadly applicable term that encompasses both the positive (""specialised in"") and negative (""not specialised in"") aspects of the relation phrases. It is a neutral term that can be used to indicate the domain of expertise or lack thereof in a more general sense. The other two options, ""specialised in"" and ""specialised in"" (from EDC and CESI), are limited as they only reflect one side of the relation (the positive aspect) and do not capture the negative aspect (""not specialised in"") effectively."

It is clear and retains the conditional ""could,"" which is important for indicating potentiality rather than certainty. The label from CoT, while semantically similar, introduces the term ""difficulties"" which, although a synonym, moves away from the specific metaphorical language of ""headwinds.""

It also uses ""for"" instead of ""to,"" which is more idiomatic in English when discussing the effects or consequences of something. The word ""additional"" is omitted, as it is not essential for the broad semantic coverage of the relation phrases and its inclusion might imply a context that is not always applicable. Overall, this label is clear, concise, and captures the essence of all the given phrases."

The term ""headwind"" is metaphorical and might not be immediately clear to all users, especially those not familiar with aviation or nautical terminology where the term is more commonly used.

The label ""is large in"" proposed by CoT changes the adjective ""sizeable"" to ""large,"" which could imply a slightly different meaning, as ""large"" is often interpreted as bigger than ""sizeable.""

It captures the essence of all the phrases, which describe a reduction in the difference between two entities or values. This label is clear, succinct, and broadly applicable to the given phrases, as it does not specify the means of narrowing (e.g., ""projected"" or ""implied"") and thus can be used in a variety of contexts where the gap is being reduced."

It implies a broader spectrum of price movements (fluctuations) and their connections (associated with) to other factors, which can be applicable to both the development and indexing contexts. The terms ""developed"" and ""linked to"" are both adequately represented by ""associated with,"" which conveys a sense of correlation or causation.

It has broad semantic coverage and is clear in its meaning. The capitalization in ""Regressed on"" from CoT is unnecessary since relation phrases typically do not require capitalization unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. ""Regressed against"" is less commonly used and might be slightly less clear, although it is semantically similar. Therefore, ""regressed on"" from CESI is the best label for representing the given phrases."

Both CESI and EDC proposed ""structure,"" which suggests a consensus on its applicability and relevance. ""Organization"" proposed by CoT is also relevant, but it is slightly more specific and may not cover all possible uses of the term ""structure"" in a knowledge graph context.

It captures the essence of a rapid rise in value or quantity, which is implied by the word ""spiked"" in all variations. Additionally, it is neutral with respect to the timing of the spike (in, on, after), making it broadly applicable. The term ""Temporary spike after"" also suggests a sudden increase, but with a time-bound context, which is still covered by the more general term ""Sudden increase.""

It is a broader term that can be applied to various financial contexts and covers the semantic meaning of both maturity-related phrases. Neither ""mature date"" nor ""mature amount"" alone sufficiently captures the full semantic range of the phrases provided, as they each represent only one aspect of financial maturity.

- says",said,States,said,said,CESI,"The relation phrases ""said"" and ""says"" both refer to the act of uttering or expressing in words. The label ""said"" is in the past tense, which is commonly used in reporting or attributing speech and can encompass instances of ""says"" in a general sense. The label ""States"" proposed by CoT is also a good fit semantically, but it is more formal and less frequently used in everyday language. The label ""said"" is more universally applicable and is already a common choice in two out of the three systems, indicating a consensus. Therefore, ""said"" is the best label for representing the given relation phrases due to its clarity, broad semantic coverage, and general applicability."
256,256,"- reason for favorable financial conditions
- financial conditions comparison",reason for favorable financial conditions,"""Assessing and Comparing Financial Conditions""",reason for favorable financial conditions,"""Assessing and Comparing Financial Conditions""",CoT,"The chosen label encompasses both the idea of understanding the reasons behind favorable financial conditions and the act of comparing different financial conditions. It is broad enough to cover the semantic range of both phrases, implying an evaluation process that could include identifying reasons as well as comparing different states of financial conditions.

257,257,"- limiting aspect 2
- limiting aspect 1",limiting aspect 2,"""Limiting Aspect""",limiting aspect 2,"""Limiting Aspect""",CoT,"The label ""Limiting Aspect"" is the most appropriate choice as it captures the essence of both ""limiting aspect 1"" and ""limiting aspect 2"" without specifying a particular order or number. This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to any similar relation phrase that may indicate a limiting aspect. It abstracts away the numerical distinction, which is likely less important for the canonical representation, focusing instead on the core concept of a limiting aspect."
258,258,"- recession accounted by
- has recession
- recession due to",recession due to,"""Recession caused by""",recession accounted by,"""Recession caused by""",CoT,"The label ""Recession caused by"" is the most clear and broadly applicable term that encompasses the semantics of all the given phrases. It implies a direct causative relationship, which is a common thread among the phrases. ""Recession accounted by"" and ""recession due to"" both suggest a causal link, but ""accounted by"" is less commonly used in this context and might imply a more passive or descriptive relationship rather than a direct cause. ""Recession due to"" is also a valid representation, but ""Recession caused by"" is more forceful and widely understood to imply causation, making it the best choice for representing the given relation phrases."
259,259,"- for recession probability
- implied recession probability",implied recession probability,"""Recession Probability""",for recession probability,"""Recession Probability""",CoT,"The label ""Recession Probability"" is the most clear and broadly applicable term that encompasses both ""for recession probability"" and ""implied recession probability"". It removes the qualifiers ""for"" and ""implied"", which may not be necessary for a canonical label and could limit semantic coverage.

- broad based",broad based,Broadly distributed,were broad based across,Broadly distributed,CoT,"The phrase ""broadly distributed"" captures the essence of both ""were broad based across"" and ""broad based"" by indicating a wide-ranging spread or distribution, which is the common theme in the given phrases. It is clear, concise, and has the broad semantic coverage needed to represent the concept of something being spread out or extensive in scope. The term ""broad based"" alone could be interpreted as having a wide foundation but does not necessarily imply distribution, while ""were broad based across"" is more specific and less generalizable. ""Broadly distributed"" strikes a balance between specificity and general applicability."
262,262,"- increased stockbuilding till
- time of increased stockbuilding",increased stockbuilding till,Time of Increased Stockbuilding,increased stockbuilding till,Time of Increased Stockbuilding,CoT,"The label ""Time of Increased Stockbuilding"" captures the essence of both phrases by emphasizing the temporal aspect (""time"" and ""till"") and the main action (""increased stockbuilding""). It is more descriptive and general than the alternative, which seems to imply a cutoff point with the word ""till"" but does not explicitly mention the temporal context. The chosen label has broader semantic coverage and is more universally applicable to various contexts where the time frame of increased stockbuilding is relevant."
263,263,"- median

It reflects a change in length without specifying the direction of the change, making it broadly applicable to any situation where the length differs from the norm. The other two labels, ""shorter than usual"" and ""longer than usual in,"" are more specific and only represent one direction of deviation.

- buoyed",being buoyed by,Boosted by,expected to be buoyed by,Boosted by,CoT,"The label ""Boosted by"" captures the essence of all three phrases, which is the act of being lifted or supported by something. It is clear and concise, and it has broad semantic coverage that can easily apply to various contexts where something is being positively influenced or supported. The term ""boosted"" is more general and thus can represent the specific conditions implied by ""expected to be buoyed by"" and ""being buoyed by"" without limiting the scope to current or future expectations."

- total envelope
- has envelope",has total envelope,Has envelope,has total envelope,Has envelope,CoT,"The label ""Has envelope"" is broad enough to encompass the meaning of all the given phrases while being clear and concise. The word ""total"" in the other options may imply a specificity that is not present in all the original phrases.

- additional envelope amount",additional envelope amount,Additional fee for temporary envelope,additional amount for temporary envelope,Additional fee for temporary envelope,CoT,"The label ""Additional fee for temporary envelope"" chosen from the CoT system seems to best encapsulate the meaning of the original phrases. It maintains the notion of an ""additional"" cost, specifies that it is a ""fee,"" which is a more common term than ""amount"" in the context of payments, and retains the ""temporary envelope"" aspect, which is important for understanding the context of the fee.

271,271,"- phased in
- phased in after",phased in,Phased In,phased in,phased in,EDC,"The label ""phased in"" is written in lowercase, which is generally more appropriate for a canonical label in a knowledge graph as it maintains consistency and avoids unnecessary capitalization. Both ""phased in"" and ""phased in after"" imply a process or action being gradually implemented, and the label ""phased in"" captures this concept succinctly. The ""after"" in the second phrase can be considered context-specific and does not need to be included in the canonical label for it to remain broadly applicable. The CESI and EDC systems propose the same label, which is the most straightforward and inclusive option for representing the given phrases. The CoT system's label ""Phased In"" is semantically identical but uses unnecessary capitalization."
272,272,"- percentage for conditions

It captures the essence of temporariness that is common to all the given phrases without being overly specific to removal or nature. It is general enough to apply to various contexts where a temporary state or condition is being described, which is likely the intended semantic meaning behind the original phrases."
275,275,"- diverting exports to
- diverting exports from",diverting exports from,Diverting Exports,diverting exports to,Diverting Exports,CoT,"The label ""Diverting Exports"" is the most inclusive and general term that encompasses both the action of diverting exports to a new destination and diverting exports from an original source. It captures the essence of the activity without specifying the direction, making it broadly applicable to various contexts where the specific direction of the diversion is either unknown, irrelevant, or can be inferred from additional context.

281,281,"- reallocation to
- reallocate to",reallocate to,'Reallocate to',reallocation to,"""reallocate to""",CoT,"The phrase ""reallocate to"" is in the base verb form, which generally allows for broader semantic coverage and application. It is clear and concise, and it can easily represent the action described by both phrases ""reallocation to"" and ""reallocate to"".

284,284,"- mechanism for spillover
- illustrates spillover effect in",mechanism for spillover,'Describing spillover process and effects',mechanism for spillover,'Describing spillover process and effects',CoT,"The label 'Describing spillover process and effects' is the most comprehensive and broadly applicable among the options. It encompasses both the mechanism (process) and the outcome (effects) of spillover, which are implied in both original phrases. The use of the gerund ""Describing"" also suggests an ongoing or general action, which fits the varied contexts in which the original phrases might be used.

It maintains the semantic core of investigation or analysis related to trust, which is present in all the original phrases. The label suggested by CoT, ""Analyzing the role of trust in,"" is also a strong candidate, but it is slightly more specific to analysis, whereas ""explores"" can be interpreted more broadly to include various methods of inquiry. The EDC label, ""characterized by trust in,"" is more restrictive and does not capture the exploratory aspect of the other two phrases."
287,287,"- amount in France

It is clear and concise, and as a canonical label, it is preferable to use the infinitive or base form of a verb for consistency and ease of mapping other related phrases. ""Engages in conflict"" is also semantically similar, but it is less concise and includes an additional word (""engages in"") that may not be necessary to represent the core action described by the original phrases."

It is clear and maintains the general applicability of the relation, making it suitable as a canonical label.

308,308,"- is competing with
- competition for",competition for,is in competition with,is competing with,is competing with,EDC,"The label ""is competing with"" is clear and directly captures the essence of a competitive relationship between entities. It is broad enough to cover various contexts where competition might occur and is generally applicable to different scenarios where the original phrases might be used.

- income form
- regular income form",income form,Type of Income,income type,Type of Income,CoT,"The phrase ""Type of Income"" encompasses both the specificity of ""income type"" and the generality of ""income form"" and ""regular income form.""

It is also clear and easily understandable."
313,313,"- in net terms
- reported in net terms",in net terms,Reporting in net terms,in net terms,in net terms,EDC,"The phrase ""in net terms"" is concise and captures the essence of both given phrases without adding additional context that might not be applicable in all situations. ""Reporting in net terms"" from CoT introduces the action of reporting, which is not present in the first phrase ""in net terms.""

It is clear and has a broad semantic coverage that can apply to various instances where an exception to a correlation is observed. The use of ""expected"" adds a general applicability to different contexts where correlations can occur, making it a versatile choice."
315,315,"- conditioned on
- conditioning through
- conditioned by",conditioned on,Determined by,conditioned on,Determined by,CoT,"The phrases ""conditioned on,"" ""conditioning through,"" and ""conditioned by"" all imply a causal or determining relationship where one factor influences or determines another. The term ""Determined by"" captures the essence of a determining relationship more broadly and inclusively than ""conditioned on,"" which suggests a more specific scenario where something is contingent upon a condition. ""Determined by"" is more general and can apply to a wider range of causal relationships, making it a better canonical label for representing all the given relation phrases."
316,316,"- could potentially prolong
- might prolong",might prolong,"""May extend""",could potentially prolong,"""might prolong""",CESI,"The label ""might prolong"" is a good middle ground that captures the essence of both ""could potentially prolong"" and ""might prolong"" without being too verbose or too concise. It maintains the uncertainty inherent in both phrases and is easily understood and applicable in a variety of contexts. The other options either add unnecessary complexity (like ""could potentially"") or change the modality slightly (""May extend"" is a bit more assertive than ""might"")."

It implies a general relationship with a collection without specifying the nature of the connection, which makes it applicable to various contexts where the original phrases might be used.

It has broad semantic coverage as it can be applied to various contexts where something is brought to an end, and it is general enough to encompass the slight variation in the original phrases. The term ""termination"" is synonymous with ""cessation,"" and ""caused"" is a more general term than ""led to,"" which can imply a more indirect role in the ending. Therefore, ""Caused termination"" is the most inclusive and representative label of the given relation phrases."

It covers the semantic meaning of both phrases by implying that the action has not been initiated (not submitted) and not completed (not granted through).

- not returning to
- not return to",not return to,Not returning to,not returned to,Not returning to,CoT,"The phrase ""Not returning to"" is in the present continuous tense, which generally indicates an ongoing state or action. This form can cover both the intention not to return (future-oriented) and the current state of not being in the process of returning (present-oriented). It is also more active than ""not returned to,"" which is in the past participle form and might imply a completed action. ""Not return to"" is in the infinitive form, which is less specific about the time aspect. Therefore, ""Not returning to"" is the most flexible and broadly applicable label, as it can encompass the ongoing nature of the action across different contexts and time frames."
323,323,"- key trading partners include

It is general enough to apply to various contexts within a knowledge graph while still conveying the essential relationship between entities. The CESI label omits unnecessary specificity such as ""key"" and ""include,"" which can be context-dependent and not always applicable. The CoT label is capitalized, which is not necessary for a canonical label and does not add clarity or meaning. Therefore, ""trading partners"" is the most suitable choice."

It is clearer and more broadly applicable than the more specific and somewhat redundant phrases provided by EDC and CESI. ""Managing"" suggests an ongoing process of oversight and adjustment, which can include both maintaining and depending on various factors, thus covering a wider range of potential activities within the scope of monetary policy management."
325,325,"- discourage demand for
- dampens demand for
- might dampen demand for",dampens demand for,Decrease demand for,discourage demand for,Decrease demand for,CoT,"The label ""Decrease demand for"" is chosen because it is the most general and broadly applicable term that encompasses the meanings of all the given phrases. It clearly communicates the idea that the demand for something is being reduced, without specifying the method or degree of reduction, which makes it semantically inclusive of the other phrases. ""Dampens demand for"" and ""discourage demand for"" are more specific in their connotations and might not fully capture the potential subtlety of ""might dampen demand for,"" which implies a possibility rather than a definite outcome. ""Decrease demand for"" is neutral and widely understandable, making it the best canonical label for representing the given relation phrases."
326,326,"- willing to pay more for
- willingness for
- willing to pay for",willing to pay for,Willingness to Pay,willing to pay more for,Willingness to Pay,CoT,"The label ""Willingness to Pay"" captures the essence of all three phrases by reflecting the concept of a readiness or inclination to pay, without specifying an amount or comparison (such as ""more"").

328,328,"- increasingly leveraged
- higher leverage than",increasingly leveraged,Utilization of higher leverage,increasingly leveraged,increasingly leveraged,CESI,"The phrase ""increasingly leveraged"" captures the essence of both given phrases by indicating a progressive use of leverage, which is a common theme in the provided examples. The term ""higher leverage than"" implies a comparative increase, which aligns with the notion of ""increasingly."" The alternative, ""Utilization of higher leverage,"" introduces a new word ""utilization"" that is not present in the original phrases and may narrow the scope by suggesting a specific action rather than a trend or state. Therefore, ""increasingly leveraged"" is more direct and broadly applicable, making it a better canonical label for representing the given relation phrases."
329,329,"- waits for details of
- wait for",waits for details of,Waiting for,waits for details of,Waiting for,CoT,"The label ""Waiting for"" is the most general and broadly applicable of the three options. It captures the essential meaning of both ""waits for details of"" and ""wait for"" without being overly specific. The phrases indicate a state of anticipation or the act of expecting something, which is succinctly and clearly conveyed by ""Waiting for."" The other two options are more specific and may not cover instances where the details are not the primary focus of the waiting, thus limiting their semantic coverage."

It accounts for both entities (PSPP and CSPP) and both actions (was, increased by), providing a template that can be used to express all the given relation phrases.

- hardest hit in employment losses
- among workers lost employment in",lost employment in,Employment Loss,lost employment in,Employment Loss,CoT,"The label ""Employment Loss"" is clear, concise, and captures the broad semantic meaning of all the given phrases. It abstracts the concept of losing employment in a way that is generally applicable to various contexts, without being tied to a specific grammatical structure. It also encompasses the idea of ""hardest hit in employment losses,"" suggesting a significant scale or impact, which is not as clearly conveyed by the more literal ""lost employment in."""
332,332,"- cannot infer from
- cannot be attributed to",cannot be attributed to,Cannot establish causality from,cannot infer from,Cannot establish causality from,CoT,"This label encompasses the meaning of both ""cannot infer from"" and ""cannot be attributed to"" by addressing the inability to draw a causal relationship from the given information. It implies that there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive connection, which is a broader and more universally applicable concept than the other two options. ""Cannot infer from"" might be too narrow as it focuses on the act of making an inference, which is a subset of establishing causality. ""Cannot be attributed to"" is also narrower, as it specifically refers to the act of assigning responsibility or cause. ""Cannot establish causality from"" covers both aspects and is therefore the most representative label for the group of phrases."
333,333,"- indicate not exclusively targeting
- did not exclusively target",indicate not exclusively targeting,Not exclusively targeted,indicate not exclusively targeting,Not exclusively targeted,CoT,"The label ""Not exclusively targeted"" is clear, concise, and captures the essence of the phrases ""indicate not exclusively targeting"" and ""did not exclusively target"" without the additional verb ""indicate"" or the past tense ""did,"" which are not necessary for the canonical label.

It clearly conveys the action of causing a depressive state, which is implied by all variations of the word ""depress"" in the context provided. While ""Depress"" and ""Depresses"" are also accurate, they are less specific and could be interpreted in a broader range of meanings, including the literal lowering of something physical or metaphorical.

338,338,"- rise backdrop
- backdrop",backdrop,Backdrop Scene,rise backdrop,backdrop,CESI,"The label ""backdrop"" is the most inclusive and general term that encompasses both phrases ""rise backdrop"" and ""backdrop"" without adding additional context that may not apply to all instances of the relation. ""Backdrop Scene"" introduces the word ""Scene"" which may not be relevant to all contexts where ""backdrop"" is used, and ""rise backdrop"" is more specific and may not cover instances where the backdrop does not involve a ""rise."" Therefore, ""backdrop"" is the most clear and broadly applicable label."
339,339,"- joined
- joined on
- joined at stages of",joined on,Joined,joined,Joined,CoT,"The label ""Joined"" is the most broadly applicable and semantically clear representation of the given phrases. It captures the essence of the action without being too specific (""joined on"") or too vague (""joined at stages of""). The word ""joined"" is a common denominator for all phrases and can be easily understood in various contexts.

- traded with",has trade with,"""Engages in trade with""",has trade with,"""Engages in trade with""",CoT,"The chosen label ""Engages in trade with"" encompasses the idea that there is an active trading relationship between two entities, which is a common thread among all the given phrases. It implies a mutual and ongoing action, which is more descriptive and captures the dynamic aspect of trade relations better than the simpler ""has trade with."" The term ""engages"" also covers both directions of trade (implied in ""is traded with"" and ""traded with""), making it a more inclusive and representative label for the semantic similarity of the group."
341,341,"- exchanged for
- in exchange for",in exchange for,Exchange,exchanged for,Exchange,CoT,"The label ""Exchange"" is the most clear and broadly applicable term that encompasses both ""exchanged for"" and ""in exchange for"" without being tied to a specific grammatical structure.

- prerequisite for",is a prerequisite for,is a prerequisite for,is a prerequisite for,is a prerequisite for,CoT,"All three systems have proposed the same label, ""is a prerequisite for,"" which indicates a consensus among the systems. This label is clear, maintains the original meaning of the relation phrases, and is applicable in a broad range of contexts where one might need to express that one thing is required before another. It also includes the auxiliary verb ""is,"" which can provide a clearer grammatical structure when integrating the relation into sentences. Therefore, ""is a prerequisite for"" is the best label to represent the given phrases."
343,343,"- mobilises funding volume of
- mobilises investment
- mobilised funding for",mobilises funding volume of,Mobilising Financial Resources,mobilises funding volume of,Mobilising Financial Resources,CoT,"The label ""Mobilising Financial Resources"" is broad and inclusive, capturing the essence of all three phrases which involve the act of gathering or providing financial support or investment. It is clear and general enough to apply to various contexts where funds are being raised or allocated, without being tied to the specific wording of ""funding volume"" which may not always be relevant.

344,344,"- expects firms to avoid
- allow firms to avoid",expects firms to avoid,Sets expectation or permission for firms to avoid,expects firms to avoid,Sets expectation or permission for firms to avoid,CoT,"The chosen label encompasses both the notion of expectation and permission, which are the key concepts present in the given phrases. ""Expects firms to avoid"" captures only the expectation aspect, while ""allow firms to avoid"" introduces the idea of permission. The label ""Sets expectation or permission for firms to avoid"" is therefore more inclusive and accurately represents the semantic similarity between the two phrases, making it the best choice for a canonical label that covers both relations."
345,345,"- indicates rating of
- rated at",rated at,"""Assigns rating to""",indicates rating of,"""indicates rating of""",EDC,"The phrase ""indicates rating of"" is the most explicit and descriptive among the options. It clearly conveys the action of assigning a rating to something without being tied to a specific context or format, such as a numerical value implied by ""rated at."" While ""Assigns rating to"" is also a strong candidate, it is slightly more active and specific than the more neutral ""indicates rating of,"" which can cover a broader range of scenarios where a rating might be implied or stated in various ways. Therefore, ""indicates rating of"" is chosen for its clarity and semantic breadth, making it generally applicable across different contexts within a knowledge graph."
346,346,"- provided additional budget for
- financed by additional amount",provided additional budget for,Supplied additional funding,provided additional budget for,Supplied additional funding,CoT,"The label ""Supplied additional funding"" captures the essence of both phrases ""provided additional budget for"" and ""financed by additional amount"" effectively. It uses the term ""funding,"" which is a more general term than ""budget,"" allowing for broader semantic coverage that can apply to various contexts where additional financial resources are provided. The word ""supplied"" is synonymous with ""provided"" and ""financed,"" making it a suitable verb to represent the action described in both original phrases."

- can be amplified by
- amplified by
- amplified",amplified by,"""Increase in intensity""",be amplified by,"""amplified by""",CESI,"The label ""amplified by"" is clear, concise, and directly reflects the action described by all the given phrases. It captures the causative nature of the relationship, indicating that something is increased in intensity or effect due to another factor. The label ""Increase in intensity"" proposed by CoT changes the form to a noun phrase and loses the causative aspect, while ""be amplified by"" from EDC retains an auxiliary verb that is unnecessary for a canonical label. ""Amplified by"" is the most straightforward and semantically inclusive choice."
349,349,"- favor
- favours",favor,Support,favor,favor,EDC,"The phrases ""favor"" and ""favours"" are essentially the same, with the only difference being the variation in spelling (American English vs. British English). Both phrases imply a sense of preference or support given by one entity to another. The label ""favor"" directly matches the given phrases and retains the original meaning without introducing a new term. The label ""Support"" proposed by CoT, while semantically related, is slightly broader and could encompass other types of support that may not be accurately described as ""favor."" Therefore, ""favor"" is the most precise and directly applicable label among the options provided."
350,350,"- amplify
- could amplify
- amplifies",amplifies,Amplify,amplify,amplify,EDC,"The label ""amplify"" is in the base form of the verb, which generally allows for the broadest semantic coverage and general applicability. It is clear and can be easily adapted to different grammatical contexts, making it suitable to represent the given relation phrases. The choice of the base form is standard in knowledge representation because it avoids the specifics of tense and aspect that are present in forms like ""amplifies"" or ""could amplify."" Additionally, the label ""amplify"" is not case-sensitive like ""Amplify,"" which could imply a proper noun or a specific product name rather than a general action."
351,351,"- amplify effect on
- amplify effects",amplify effect on,Amplify effect,amplify effect on,amplify effect on,EDC,"The label ""amplify effect on"" includes the preposition ""on,"" which is important for indicating that the amplification is directed towards something. This preposition is present in both original phrases and is essential for maintaining the relational context. The label ""Amplify effect"" proposed by CoT lacks this preposition and could be interpreted as more general or ambiguous. ""amplify effect on"" is more specific and preserves the meaning of the original phrases, ensuring clarity and semantic coverage. Since both EDC and CESI proposed the same label, it reinforces the appropriateness of this choice."
352,352,"- focus of first question
- focus of third question
- focus of second question",focus of second question,Focus of the question,focus of first question,Focus of the question,CoT,"The label ""Focus of the question"" by CoT is the most inclusive and general, covering any question without specifying an order.

353,353,"- entitled to
- entitled",entitled,"""Has Right To""",entitled to,"""entitled to""",EDC,"The phrase ""entitled to"" captures the essence of having a right or claim to something, which is the underlying concept shared by both original phrases. It is more specific and clear than just ""entitled,"" which could be interpreted in a broader sense and might not convey the aspect of possession or right. The label ""Has Right To"" is also a good representation, but it does not match the original phrasing's structure and is less formal. ""Entitled to"" maintains the original phrasing's formality and is more directly aligned with the given phrases, making it the best choice for clarity, semantic coverage, and general applicability."
354,354,"- lower bound
- upper bound",upper bound,Range Boundaries,lower bound,Range Boundaries,CoT,"The term ""Range Boundaries"" encompasses both ""lower bound"" and ""upper bound,"" as it refers to the limits or edges of a range, which can be numerical, temporal, or of another nature. Both ""lower bound"" and ""upper bound"" are specific types of range boundaries, so the label ""Range Boundaries"" provides a broad semantic coverage that represents all the relation phrases effectively. It is also clear and general enough to be applicable in various contexts where such limits are discussed."
355,355,"- maintain policy stance to preserve
- reconfirm policy stance",maintain policy stance to preserve,Uphold policy stance,maintain policy stance to preserve,Uphold policy stance,CoT,"The term ""uphold"" captures the essence of both ""maintain"" and ""reconfirm"" as it implies keeping or supporting something that is already in place.

357,357,"- assess transmission of
- used to evaluate transmission of",assess transmission of,Evaluate transmission of,assess transmission of,Evaluate transmission of,CoT,"The term ""evaluate"" generally encompasses a broader range of activities and is often used in more formal or technical contexts. It implies a systematic determination of merit, worth, and significance of something by using criteria against a set of standards. The phrase ""assess transmission of"" can be considered a subset of ""evaluate transmission of,"" as assessment is typically a component of evaluation. Therefore, ""Evaluate transmission of"" can be seen as a more inclusive term that covers the semantic meaning of both given phrases, ensuring broad semantic coverage and general applicability."
358,358,"- InPeriod
- SincePeriod",SincePeriod,FromStartThroughPeriod,InPeriod,FromStartThroughPeriod,CoT,"The label ""FromStartThroughPeriod"" seems to encompass both ""InPeriod"" and ""SincePeriod"" by implying a duration that starts at a certain point and continues through a specific period. ""InPeriod"" suggests something happening within a specific timeframe, while ""SincePeriod"" implies a starting point and continuation from then. ""FromStartThroughPeriod"" captures the essence of both by indicating a starting point and the passage of time through a certain period, making it the most inclusive and representative of the semantic intent behind the original phrases."

- increase deposit holdings due to
- includes holding deposits with",increased deposit holdings due to,"""Changes in deposit holdings due to""",increased deposit holdings due to,"""Changes in deposit holdings due to""",CoT,"The label ""Changes in deposit holdings due to"" is chosen because it encompasses both increases and the inclusion of holding deposits, which may not necessarily be an increase but a state of holding. The word ""Changes"" is more inclusive and represents a broader semantic range, covering any alterations in deposit holdings, whether they are increases, decreases, or simply the state of inclusion. This makes it more generally applicable to the given phrases than the more specific ""increased deposit holdings due to."""
361,361,"- recipients of
- for recipients of",for recipients of,"""Recipient of""",recipients of,"""recipients of""",EDC,"The label ""recipients of"" is clear, concise, and directly captures the essence of the relationship indicated by the phrases. It has broad semantic coverage as it can be applied generally to any context where there is a recipient of something, without the additional preposition ""for"" which is present in one of the phrases but not necessary for understanding the relationship. The label also avoids the use of quotation marks as seen in the CoT proposal, which are not needed for the canonical label and could introduce unnecessary complexity."
362,362,"- created tension
- tension with",created tension,Created Tension,created tension,created tension,CoT,"The label ""created tension"" is in lowercase, which is more consistent with the standard conventions for representing relations in knowledge graphs. It is also grammatically correct and captures the essence of both phrases (""created tension"" and ""tension with"") by focusing on the action of creating tension, which is the common thread between them. The label is clear, semantically broad, and generally applicable to various contexts where these phrases might be used."
363,363,"- requires traveling more than
- has to travel more than",has to travel more than,"""Required to travel a certain distance""",requires traveling more than,"""Required to travel a certain distance""",CoT,"The chosen label ""Required to travel a certain distance"" encompasses the meaning of both given phrases while also being clear and broadly applicable. It captures the obligatory nature of the travel (""required"" and ""has to"") and the aspect of distance (""traveling more than""). The label is also neutral and does not specify a direction or mode of travel, making it more universally applicable to different contexts within a knowledge graph."
364,364,"- has to travel to
- would have to travel
- has to travel for",has to travel for,"""Required to travel""",has to travel to,"""Required to travel""",CoT,"The label ""Required to travel"" captures the essence of obligation present in all three phrases, indicating that there is a necessity for travel. It is clear and has a broad semantic coverage that encompasses the different contexts implied by the original phrases, such as a potential future obligation (""would have to travel"") and a specific purpose (""has to travel for""). It is also generally applicable to various scenarios where travel is mandated, without being tied to a particular preposition (""to"" or ""for"") that may not be relevant in all cases."

- fluctuations more limited than",fluctuations more limited than,"""Fluctuations more limited due to/compared to""",fluctuations more limited due to,"""Fluctuations more limited due to/compared to""",CoT,"This label effectively captures the essence of both phrases by including the prepositions ""due to"" and ""compared to"", which are synonymous in the context of limitations being discussed. It provides a broader semantic coverage that encompasses the reasons behind the limitations (due to) as well as a comparative aspect (compared to). This makes it more generally applicable to various scenarios where either causation or comparison is being expressed."
366,366,"- primary effect on
- primary effect via",primary effect on,"""Primary effect on""",primary effect on,"""primary effect on""",EDC,"The label ""primary effect on"" is chosen because it is clear and encompasses the broad semantic meaning of both phrases given. It captures the essence of a direct primary effect and is generally applicable to various contexts where such a relationship might be relevant. The inclusion of quotation marks in the CoT proposal is unnecessary for the canonical label itself, and the phrase ""primary effect via"" can be considered a variation of ""primary effect on,"" as ""via"" implies a pathway or method of the primary effect, which does not contradict the chosen label. Therefore, ""primary effect on"" is the most suitable canonical label."
367,367,"- striking a balance is a challenge in
- balance challenge",striking a balance is a challenge in,Difficulty in maintaining balance,striking a balance is a challenge in,Difficulty in maintaining balance,CoT,"The label ""Difficulty in maintaining balance"" captures the essence of both ""striking a balance is a challenge in"" and ""balance challenge"" while using more general language that is broadly applicable. It conveys the notion of challenge and balance without being tied to a specific context, making it a suitable canonical label for the relation phrases given. The other two options are either too verbose or identical to one of the original phrases, which may not be as inclusive of the semantic variations."
368,368,"- structural changes in
- influenced by structural transition in",structural changes in,"""Structural changes""",structural changes in,"""structural changes in""",EDC,"The phrase ""structural changes in"" is clear and directly represents the concept of a structural change occurring within a system, which is the core idea shared by both original phrases. It has broad semantic coverage and can be applied generally to various contexts where structural changes are discussed. The alternative from CoT, ""Structural changes"", is also a good candidate but lacks the preposition ""in,"" which indicates the location or system where the changes occur. This preposition is important for maintaining the relational context of the original phrases. Therefore, ""structural changes in"" is the best label to represent the given relation phrases."

The label from CoT is the most descriptive and general, as it accommodates both the concept of a previous value and a new value, as well as the idea of a change, which is implicit in the third phrase. The labels from EDC and CESI are identical and only reflect the concept of a previous value, which does not encompass the new value or the change implied in the other phrases."

It covers both buying and selling activities and allows for the prepositions ""in"" and ""of"" to be used interchangeably, which reflects the variations in the original phrases.

- translating into",translate into,Translate into,translate into,translate into,CESI,"The label ""translate into"" is in the base form (infinitive without ""to""), which makes it more neutral and broadly applicable to different contexts. It covers the action of translating in a general sense, which is common to all the given phrases. The absence of capitalization in the label makes it more versatile for use in various syntactic positions within sentences. The other options, ""CESI"" and ""CoT,"" are not actual labels but the names of systems, and ""Translate into"" with capitalization is less standard for a canonical label in a knowledge graph where labels are typically in lowercase."
372,372,"- continued to normalize despite
- will maintain throughout the process of normalizing",will maintain throughout the process of normalizing,"""Persisting during normalization""",continued to normalize despite,"""Persisting during normalization""",CoT,"The chosen label ""Persisting during normalization"" captures the essence of both phrases provided. It conveys the idea of maintaining a state or condition (in this case, normalization) despite challenges or ongoing processes, which is a common theme in both phrases. The label is clear and succinct, and it generalizes well to cover various scenarios where something continues or is maintained despite other circumstances. The other two options are more specific and less general; ""will maintain throughout the process of normalizing"" is future-oriented and specific to a process, and ""continued to normalize despite"" implies an action of normalizing rather than a state of persistence."
373,373,"- do not show
- do not exhibit
- do not face",do not exhibit,Do not display,do not show,Do not display,CoT,"The phrase ""Do not display"" encompasses the meaning of all three relation phrases given. It is clear and has a broad semantic coverage that applies to situations where something is not shown, exhibited, or faced. It is also a neutral term that is generally applicable across various contexts. The other options, ""do not show"" and ""do not exhibit,"" could be considered slightly more specific in certain contexts and may not cover the full range of scenarios implied by the original phrases. ""Do not display"" is therefore the most representative canonical label for these phrases."

The phrase ""has less investment in"" is a specific instance of diversification, as investment can be a part of a diversification strategy. The label proposed by CESI and EDC, ""less diversification than,"" therefore, has the broadest semantic coverage and is most inclusive of the given phrases. The alternative label ""Has less financial commitment in"" introduced by CoT is more specific and implies a financial aspect, which may not be as universally applicable to all scenarios of diversification."
376,376,"- abstract from

It implies a two-way or multi-way interaction that is not limited to a specific context, making it more universally applicable. Additionally, the preposition ""between"" typically denotes interaction among multiple parties or elements, which aligns well with the general idea of interplay in a knowledge graph setting."
378,378,"- increment
- was after increment",was after increment,Increment,increment,Increment,CoT,"The label ""Increment"" is clear, concise, and captures the essence of the action described by both phrases. It has broad semantic coverage as it can be applied to various contexts where an increase or step-up is involved. The phrase ""was after increment"" can be seen as a specific instance or condition of the ""Increment"" action, thus making ""Increment"" a more general and widely applicable term. The label ""Increment"" also avoids the past tense and additional context implied in ""was after increment,"" which makes it more versatile for representing the relation across different instances."
379,379,"- taken initiative
- has initiative",taken initiative,Shows initiative,taken initiative,Shows initiative,CoT,"The label ""Shows initiative"" encompasses both ""taken initiative"" and ""has initiative"" while also being more general and applicable to a wider range of contexts.

- PMI value
- has a PMI average higher than",average PMI,"""PMI Value""",average PMI,"""average PMI""",EDC,"The phrase ""average PMI"" is the most representative label for the given relation phrases as it captures the essence of all three phrases. It directly mentions ""average,"" which is a key concept in two of the phrases and implies a statistical measure, which is also relevant to the third phrase (""PMI value""). The term ""PMI Value"" suggested by CoT could be slightly ambiguous as it doesn't necessarily imply an average, which seems to be a significant aspect of the relations. Therefore, ""average PMI"" is the most clear and broadly applicable term."
381,381,"- did not expect
- do not expect",did not expect,Unforeseen,did not expect,Unforeseen,CoT,"The label ""Unforeseen"" captures the essence of both phrases ""did not expect"" and ""do not expect"" by conveying the idea that something was not anticipated or predicted. It is a clear and concise term that broadly covers the semantic meaning of the given relation phrases. While ""did not expect"" is also a good representation, ""Unforeseen"" is more general and can be applied to past, present, and future contexts, making it more versatile for use in a knowledge graph."
382,382,"- surprised to the downside in
- surprised to the downside",surprised to the downside,Underperformed,surprised to the downside in,Underperformed,CoT,"The phrases ""surprised to the downside in"" and ""surprised to the downside"" both suggest that something performed worse than expected. The term ""Underperformed"" captures the essence of both phrases succinctly and clearly, indicating that the performance was below expectations or standards. It has broad semantic coverage and is generally applicable to various contexts where performance can be measured and has been found wanting. The other candidate labels are either too specific or maintain the original phrasing, which may not be as universally understandable as ""Underperformed."""

It generalizes the concept of a shock to include both surprise and upset, which can be applicable to a variety of contexts where either of the original phrases might be used. The other two labels are more specific and tied to the original phrasing, which could limit their applicability in representing a broader range of similar relations in a knowledge graph."
384,384,"- has main theme in
- theme in",has main theme in,"""has central theme in""",has main theme in,"""has main theme in""",CESI,"The label ""has main theme in"" is a direct match for one of the given phrases and closely reflects the semantic meaning of the other phrase ""theme in"". It is clear, specific, and maintains the general applicability to represent the concept of a main theme within something. The label ""has central theme in"" proposed by CoT could also work, but it is not one of the original phrases and might imply a slightly different nuance, suggesting a singular dominant theme, whereas ""has main theme in"" can accommodate the possibility of multiple themes with one being the main. Therefore, ""has main theme in"" is the most representative and inclusive label for the given phrases."
385,385,"- strategy for
- reviewed strategy for",reviewed strategy for,"""Strategy for""",strategy for,"""strategy for""",CoT,"The label ""strategy for"" is the most inclusive and broadly applicable term that encompasses both phrases.

- pursues",pursues,"""Pursuing""",pursued by,"""pursues""",CESI,"The label ""pursues"" is the most appropriate choice as it is in the present tense and active voice, which makes it broadly applicable and semantically clear. It can represent actions directed by a subject towards an object, which covers the intent of all the given phrases. ""Pursuing"" is also a good candidate but is a gerund or present participle, which might imply an ongoing action rather than a general relation. ""Pursued by"" is in the passive voice, which limits its applicability as it specifically implies that the subject is the object of the pursuit, rather than the initiator. Therefore, ""pursues"" is the most versatile and clear representation of the given phrases."
387,387,"- surprised at
- surprised by
- surprised",surprised at,Surprised,surprised at,Surprised,CoT,"The label ""Surprised"" is the most inclusive and general form of the relation, capturing the essence of the sentiment without being tied to a specific preposition.

It is broad enough to represent the general action of either creating or enhancing a framework, which makes it applicable to a variety of contexts where either of the original phrases might be used. This label also maintains clarity by explicitly stating the two possible actions (improves or provides) related to the operational framework."
391,391,"- require comprehensive assessment
- required comprehensive assessment",require comprehensive assessment,Need for comprehensive assessment,require comprehensive assessment,require comprehensive assessment,CESI,"The chosen label ""require comprehensive assessment"" directly reflects the given phrases without altering their meaning. It is clear, concise, and maintains the active verb form ""require,"" which is present in both original phrases. The label by CoT, ""Need for comprehensive assessment,"" while semantically similar, introduces a nominalization (""Need for"") that is not present in the original phrases and could be considered less direct. Therefore, the label ""require comprehensive assessment"" is the best choice for its directness and fidelity to the original phrases."
392,392,"- becoming older over time
- ageing
- ageing of",ageing,"""Aging""",becoming older over time,"""Aging""",CoT,"The label ""Aging"" is clear, concise, and widely understood. It encompasses the process of becoming older, which is the core concept shared by all the given phrases. It also aligns with the common spelling used in American English, which is often used in international contexts. The label ""ageing"" is a valid alternative, but ""Aging"" is chosen for its simplicity and general applicability. The phrase ""becoming older over time"" is accurate but unnecessarily verbose for a canonical label."

- net of the effects
- net of",decrease net of effects,"""Decrease considering all factors""",decrease net of effects,"""Decrease considering all factors""",CoT,"The chosen label encompasses the idea of reduction while taking into account various factors or effects, which is a common theme across all the given phrases. It is clearer and more broadly understandable than the more technical phrase ""decrease net of effects."" The phrase ""Decrease considering all factors"" is also more general and can be applied to a wider range of contexts, making it a more suitable canonical label for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."

It is broad enough to encompass specific scenarios like ""tended to underperform in response to"" and ""underperformed due to,"" while also covering more general statements like ""Expect underperformance"" and ""could underperform."" The phrase ""tend to underperform in"" is also included in this broader label. The chosen label is clear, semantically inclusive, and can be generally applied to various contexts where underperformance is discussed in relation to other factors."

It is in the present tense, which allows for general application to past, present, and potential future instances of the action. The other options, ""could outperform"" and ""outperformed,"" are more specific in terms of tense and modality, which could limit their semantic coverage. ""Outperform"" is the most neutral and inclusive term to represent the given phrases."
397,397,"- Rotates back to
- Rotates back from",Rotates back to,"""Rotates back to original position""",Rotates back to,Rotates back to,EDC,"The chosen label ""Rotates back to"" is concise and captures the essence of both given phrases without adding unnecessary specificity. It is clear and has broad semantic coverage, as it can be applied to various contexts where something is rotating back to a particular point or state. The addition of ""original position"" in the second system's proposal limits the applicability of the label to only those situations where the original position is relevant, which may not always be the case. Therefore, the simpler label is more generally applicable. Both EDC and CESI proposed this label, but since we are not choosing based on order, ""Rotates back to"" is the best label for its simplicity and versatility."

- Evidence of lasting effect of",Evidence of lasting effect of,"""Enduring effect on""",lasting effects on,"""lasting effects on""",EDC,"The phrase ""lasting effects on"" is clear and concise, and it captures the essence of the semantic meaning shared by both original phrases. It indicates a prolonged impact, which is the core idea of both ""lasting effects on"" and ""Evidence of lasting effect of."" The phrase chosen by EDC is also in the plural form, which is more inclusive and can represent multiple instances of effects, thus providing broad semantic coverage. The phrase ""Evidence of lasting effect of"" is more specific and includes an unnecessary reference to ""evidence,"" which may not be applicable in all contexts. The CoT's suggestion of ""Enduring effect on"" is semantically similar but slightly less common in usage than ""lasting effects on,"" which may affect its general applicability."
399,399,"- recovery will hinge on
- hinge on recovery in",recovery will hinge on,Outcome dependent on recovery,recovery will hinge on,Outcome dependent on recovery,CoT,"The phrase ""Outcome dependent on recovery"" captures the essence of both given phrases by emphasizing the dependency of one event's outcome on the recovery process. It abstracts the concept of ""hinge on"" to ""dependent on,"" which is broadly understandable and applicable across various contexts.

It captures the idea of someone making a case for a certain position or role, which is the common thread between the two phrases. The other options are either too specific to one phrase (""argued to be"") or less clear in their semantic scope (""argue role for"").

401,401,"- doubled by
- doubled to maintain",doubled to maintain,"""Doubled""",doubled by,"""doubled by""",EDC,"The phrase ""doubled by"" is more general and broadly applicable than ""doubled to maintain,"" which seems to imply a specific purpose for the doubling. The label ""Doubled"" proposed by CoT lacks a preposition, which is important for indicating the directionality of the relation. ""Doubled by"" can be used in a variety of contexts to indicate that something has been increased by a factor of two, making it the most suitable choice for a canonical label that covers the semantic meaning of both given phrases."
402,402,"- is an index of
- has indices based on
- indexed to",is an index of,"""is indexed by""",is an index of,"""is an index of""",CESI,"The phrase ""is an index of"" is the most straightforward and clear among the options. It directly implies that one entity serves as an index for another, which is the core idea shared by all the given phrases. ""Has indices based on"" and ""indexed to"" both suggest a similar relationship, but ""is an index of"" is the most direct way to express this relationship. The alternative offered by CoT, ""is indexed by,"" reverses the direction of the relationship, which could lead to confusion when trying to represent the original phrases uniformly. Therefore, ""is an index of"" is the best choice for its clarity and directness in capturing the intended meaning of all the phrases."

It encompasses all variations of the tense and aspect of the verb found in the given phrases (present, past, and continuous), making it the most versatile and clear choice for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph. It is also in the infinitive form, which is commonly used in English to refer to the general action or concept without specifying the subject or the time of the action, thus providing a neutral and inclusive canonical label."

It uses clear and formal language that is suitable for a canonical label in a knowledge graph. The word ""exhibits"" is a neutral term that effectively captures the essence of both ""has"" and ""shows,"" while ""a decrease in growth momentum"" is a precise description that covers both ""weakening"" and ""easing"" of growth momentum."

It captures the essence that a threshold is being set or defined, which is a common theme across the phrases ""mentioned threshold is,"" ""has threshold,"" and ""threshold value."" The label is also general enough to be applicable in various contexts where a threshold is being indicated, making it a suitable canonical label for these semantically similar phrases. In contrast, ""mentioned threshold is"" may imply a more specific context of mentioning rather than setting or defining, and thus may not cover all possible uses as effectively."

It implies the presence of a coordinating entity without specifying the direction of coordination, making it broadly applicable and semantically inclusive. Additionally, it is clear and concise. The choice between CESI and CoT is arbitrary since they proposed the same label, but CESI is selected here as it is listed first."
407,407,"- foster trust in
- fosters trust",foster trust in,Foster trust,foster trust in,foster trust in,EDC,"The phrase ""foster trust in"" captures the essence of the action and the directionality implied in the original phrases. It indicates that trust is being encouraged within a particular context or towards something specific, which is a key aspect of the semantic meaning. The alternative ""Foster trust"" lacks the preposition ""in,"" which provides important information about the object of trust. Therefore, ""foster trust in"" is a more precise and semantically rich choice, offering clear and broad semantic coverage for the relation phrases provided."

It captures the essence of the change in slope implied by the original phrases while being broad enough to cover various contexts where this change might occur. It is also more explanatory than simply repeating one of the original phrases, which may not be as immediately clear to all users."
410,410,"- squeezing
- squeezed during
- squeezing expected during
- squeezed in",squeezed during,Squeezing,squeezing,squeezing,EDC,"The label ""squeezing"" is in the base form of the verb, which generally allows for broader semantic coverage and can be adapted to different tenses and contexts. It captures the essence of the action without being tied to a specific temporal context, unlike ""squeezed during,"" which implies a past action. The capitalization in ""Squeezing"" from CoT does not add semantic value and is not necessary for a canonical label, which is typically case-insensitive in knowledge graphs. Therefore, ""squeezing"" is the most clear and generally applicable choice."
411,411,"- fiscal stance
- fiscal action",fiscal stance,Fiscal Policy Actions,fiscal stance,Fiscal Policy Actions,CoT,"The label ""Fiscal Policy Actions"" is more inclusive and descriptive, as it encompasses both the stance and the actions taken within the realm of fiscal policy. It implies a broader range of activities and decisions that a government might undertake regarding fiscal matters, such as taxation and government spending. The terms ""fiscal stance"" and ""fiscal action"" can both be considered subsets of ""Fiscal Policy Actions,"" which makes it a more comprehensive choice for representing the given phrases semantically."

It provides a broader semantic coverage that includes both the cause (time of relaxation) and the effect (consequences), thus representing the full spectrum of the original phrases. The other two options, ""time of relaxation,"" only capture the aspect of duration but not the resultant effects, making them less comprehensive."

It is a clear and general term that can be applied to various contexts where a negative aspect or con of a subject is being discussed. While ""drawback of"" is also a suitable label, ""disadvantage of"" is slightly more formal and universally applicable, making it a better choice for a canonical label that represents the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."

It is concise and directly captures the essence of the phrases like 'destination area', 'has destination', 'with destination', and 'destination for'. The term 'destination area' is slightly more specific and may not cover all contexts implied by the other phrases. The label ""'Destination'"" with quotation marks from CoT is less conventional and could introduce unnecessary complexity or confusion in a knowledge graph setting. Therefore, ""destination"" from CESI is the best choice for representing the semantic meaning of the given phrases."
416,416,"- firms considered
- firms selected based on",firms considered,Firms making selection based on criteria,firms considered,firms considered,CESI,"The label ""firms considered"" is clear and concise, and it captures the essence of both phrases provided. The phrase ""firms selected based on"" implies a consideration process, which is adequately represented by the term ""considered."" The alternative label ""Firms making selection based on criteria"" introduces additional complexity and specificity that is not present in the original phrases (e.g., ""making selection"" and ""based on criteria""), which may not be applicable in all instances where the original phrases might be used. Therefore, ""firms considered"" is the most suitable canonical label for its simplicity and broad semantic coverage that aligns with the given relation phrases."

- associated reappraisal of",associated reappraisal of,Cause Reappraisal,cause reappraisal,cause reappraisal,EDC,"The phrase ""cause reappraisal"" is clear, concise, and captures the essence of both given phrases. It implies a causative action leading to a reappraisal, which is a broad and general concept that can encompass the idea of being ""associated with a reappraisal"" as well. The capitalization in ""Cause Reappraisal"" (CoT's proposal) does not add semantic value and is not necessary for a canonical label. ""Associated reappraisal of"" (CESI's proposal) is more specific and implies a connection rather than causation, which may not be as broadly applicable as the causative ""cause reappraisal."" Therefore, ""cause reappraisal"" is the most appropriate label for general use."

It implies a medium or conduit through which something is transmitted or conveyed, which is the common thread among the phrases. The alternatives either add unnecessary complexity (""appears as channel for"") or use a less common phrasing (""Acts as a channel"").

It is broader and more inclusive than ""allows for effective delivery of,"" as it implies not just permission but also the provision of means or assistance. This makes it a more comprehensive representation of the concept of aiding in the effective distribution or conveyance of something. The term ""facilitates"" also has a more general applicability than the more specific ""allows for,"" making it suitable for a wider range of contexts within a knowledge graph."

It is broad enough to encompass both the specific case of ""stock of excess savings"" and the more general ""savings."" By omitting the more detailed ""stock of excess,"" the label maintains general applicability to various contexts where the assumption of savings is discussed, without losing essential meaning.

It indicates a categorization of different forms of inflation, which is the underlying concept shared by all the phrases. ""InflationType"" and ""related to inflation type"" are less clear; the former is a compound word that might be less immediately understandable, and the latter suggests a relation but is less direct in indicating a categorical classification.

It encompasses not only the action (reform by, reformed by, aimed to reform, has planned reform, reformed following) but also the concept of related changes (related reforms).

This label covers the semantic meaning of all three phrases, implying that the factors are not merely associated with change but play a role in inducing it. It is broader and more descriptive than simply ""change factor,"" and it avoids potential ambiguity by specifying that these factors induce change, aligning well with the phrase ""influence change factors."""

It uses the more common word order found in English, where the noun (""percent"") typically precedes the past participle used as an adjective (""attributed""). This label is also directly one of the original phrases, ensuring that it represents the semantic intent without alteration. It is clear, straightforward, and likely to be easily understood in a variety of contexts, making it broadly applicable."

It covers the notion of extrapolation without being tied to a specific temporal direction (before or after) or method (differently, by). This label allows for the broad semantic coverage of all the given phrases, as it can be applied regardless of the specific context in which the extrapolation occurs.

It implies that an entity is subject to regulation without specifying the direction of the regulatory action, which is a commonality in all the given phrases. This makes it more inclusive and representative of the various ways in which the concept of regulation can be expressed. The phrases ""regulated as,"" ""regulated by,"" and ""regulates"" all imply a form of undergoing regulation, either as the regulator or the regulated party. The phrase ""require regulation as"" also fits under this umbrella since it implies a necessity for undergoing regulation. Therefore, ""Undergoes regulation"" is the most suitable label as it captures the essence of all the given phrases in a clear and broadly applicable manner."
433,433,"- increase not distorted by
- not distorted by",not distorted by,Not distorted by increase,increase not distorted by,"""not distorted by""",CESI,"The phrase ""not distorted by"" is the most broadly applicable and semantically clear label that encompasses the meaning of both given phrases. It captures the core idea that there is no distortion by some factor, which is the common theme in both original phrases. The addition of ""increase"" in the other two labels may not always be relevant, as the concept of ""increase"" is not intrinsic to the idea of being ""not distorted by"" something. Therefore, ""not distorted by"" is the most suitable canonical label for representing the given relation phrases."
434,434,"- not reinvest all
- does not reinvest all",not reinvest all,Not reinvesting all,not reinvest all,not reinvest all,EDC,"The label ""not reinvest all"" directly reflects the phrasing of the given relation phrases without introducing a change in verb tense or capitalization. It maintains the original meaning and is applicable to the context where either phrase might be used. Both ""EDC"" and ""CESI"" proposed this label, and it is chosen for its simplicity and direct match with the input phrases.

435,435,"- will not reinvest
- not reinvest",will not reinvest,Not reinvesting,will not reinvest,Not reinvesting,CoT,"The label ""Not reinvesting"" captures the essence of both phrases while using the gerund form ""reinvesting,"" which is more neutral and broadly applicable.

It is clear and concise, and it avoids specific contexts such as ""in"" or ""at a slower pace than,"" making it broadly applicable to various situations where monetary policy is being made more stringent. It also uses the gerund form ""tightening,"" which is more inclusive of ongoing or continuous actions, similar to the other phrases. The label from CESI, ""tightening monetary policy in,"" includes an unnecessary preposition that limits its general applicability, while the EDC and CoT proposals are less inclusive of the ongoing action implied by some of the phrases."

It is broad enough to encompass the various nuances of the phrases like ""invaded,"" ""launched an invasion on,"" and ""launched offensive on,"" while also being specific enough to indicate the nature of the action, which is an invasion. The phrase ""Hostile Action"" is too broad and could refer to a wide range of actions beyond invasions. ""Invaded on"" is less clear and grammatically incomplete when standing alone.

It is clear, broad in semantic coverage, and generally applicable to the given relation phrases. The label from EDC and CESI is identical, but the CoT label includes unnecessary quotation marks which do not add to the semantic clarity or coverage.

The other two labels, ""decelerated in"" and ""decelerated in,"" are more limited as they focus only on the action of deceleration without explicitly acknowledging the cause, which is a significant semantic component in the set of phrases provided."
447,447,"- coincided with effect ending
- coincided with",coincided with,Coinciding with,coincided with effect ending,Coinciding with,CoT,"The label ""Coinciding with"" is clear, concise, and captures the essence of both phrases ""coincided with effect ending"" and ""coincided with."" It has broad semantic coverage and can be generally applied to various scenarios where events or effects coincide with one another. The other labels are either too specific or redundant.

Both ""Risk Direction"" and ""risk direction"" represent the phrases semantically, but the use of all lowercase by EDC and CESI suggests a more general and canonical form, which is typically preferred in knowledge graphs for consistency and ease of automated processing. The label ""risk direction"" also directly reflects the phrasing of the given relation phrases without any additional formatting or capitalization, making it the most straightforward choice."

- sampled as",sampled from,"""Extracts subset from""",uses sample of,"""sampled from""",CESI,"The phrase ""sampled from"" is broad enough to encompass the act of using a sample, taking a sample, or the state of being a sample. It is clear and concise, and it implies the action of taking a subset from a larger set, which is a common theme across all the given phrases. The other options are either too specific (like ""uses sample of"") or slightly more complex and less direct (like ""Extracts subset from"").

It implies a reduction in response to some stimulus, which is a broader and more general concept that can apply to various contexts. While ""responded by scaling back"" is more specific and includes the cause for scaling back, it is also more verbose and context-dependent. ""Reduced in response"" is also a good candidate as it conveys a similar meaning, but it is slightly less direct than ""scaled back"" and could imply a broader range of reduction types, not necessarily scaling back an operation or effort. ""Scaled back"" strikes a balance between brevity and semantic coverage, making it the best label among the three options."

It is clearer and more broadly applicable because it denotes the action directly, whereas ""inhibited by"" is a passive construction that implies the action is being done to the subject, which may not always be the case when representing the relationship in a knowledge graph.

""Requires time"" is a more general and semantically inclusive label."

Additionally, ""note"" is the singular form, which can be considered more inclusive as it can represent the concept as a whole, encompassing both singular and plural instances. The plural form ""notes"" could imply multiple, which may not always be the case. Therefore, ""note"" is the most clear, broadly semantically applicable, and generally applicable label among the options."

It implies a direction or tendency of skewness, which is a common theme in the original phrases. The word ""towards"" indicates a direction, similar to ""to,"" but is more commonly used in this context and is therefore more likely to be understood by a wider audience. The phrase also retains the passive construction found in the original phrases, which is important for indicating that the skewness is a state or condition rather than an action. ""Is biased towards"" could also be a good fit semantically, but it introduces the word ""biased,"" which has a slightly different connotation and might not be as precise for certain data in a knowledge graph where ""skewness"" is a more accurate description."

Since two out of the three systems proposed ""includes specification,"" it also indicates a consensus toward this label being more representative.

- cancellation negatively impacts",cancellation hampering,"""Cancellation causes disruption""",cancellation hampering,"""Cancellation causes disruption""",CoT,"The label ""Cancellation causes disruption"" is chosen because it captures the essence of both phrases ""cancellation hampering"" and ""cancellation negatively impacts"" effectively. It implies that a cancellation is leading to some sort of negative consequence or interference, which is a broader and more inclusive way of describing the relationship between cancellation and its effects. This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to various contexts where cancellation leads to negative outcomes. The other two labels, ""cancellation hampering"" and ""cancellation hampering"" (which are the same), are more specific and do not encompass the full range of potential negative impacts implied by the original phrases."
464,464,"- date of spread value
- spread value",spread value,'Date-Specific Spread Value',date of spread value,"""spread value""",CESI,"The label ""spread value"" is broad enough to encompass both the specificity of a date-related spread value and a general spread value without a date. It is clear and directly reflects the core concept present in both phrases. By not including ""date of"" in the canonical label, we avoid limiting the scope to only those instances where a date is specified, thus ensuring general applicability to any spread value, regardless of whether it is associated with a specific date or not."

- greater disparity in",smaller disparity in,Disparity in,smaller disparity in,Disparity in,CoT,"The label ""Disparity in"" is the most inclusive and general term that can encompass both ""smaller disparity in"" and ""greater disparity in."" It captures the essence of the relation, which is the existence of a disparity, without specifying the degree. This makes it broadly applicable to various contexts where the specific degree of disparity can be quantified or described separately. Both ""smaller disparity in"" and ""greater disparity in"" are specific instances of ""Disparity in,"" making it the most semantically comprehensive choice."

It encompasses both ""shorter term"" and ""longer term"" expectations, which are mentioned in the original phrases. The CESI and EDC proposals are too specific as they only cover one aspect of the time frame (""longer term"" and ""shorter term"" respectively), while the CoT label captures the idea of expectation changes over varying time frames, which is a common theme in all the phrases."
467,467,"- used fiscal support fraction

It is broad enough to cover the semantic meaning of all the given phrases while being specific enough to convey a clear understanding of the relationship. It also generalizes the concept of fiscal support to government support, which is a term more widely understood and applicable."
468,468,"- acquire assets
- in assets",acquire assets,Asset Acquisition and Possession,acquire assets,Asset Acquisition and Possession,CoT,"The label ""Asset Acquisition and Possession"" encompasses both the act of acquiring assets and the state of having assets (""in assets"" implies possession). It is broader and more descriptive than simply ""acquire assets,"" which does not explicitly cover the concept of possession.

- remained insulated from",insulated from,'Insulated from',insulated from,insulated from,EDC,"The label ""insulated from"" is clear, concise, and directly captures the essence of all the given phrases without any additional formatting or unnecessary words. It covers the semantic meaning common to all phrases, which is the state of being protected or separated from something. The use of quotation marks in CoT's suggestion is unnecessary for a canonical label, and the phrase ""more insulated from"" in the list of phrases is a comparative form that still fits under the broader concept of being ""insulated from."" Thus, ""insulated from"" is the most appropriate choice for general applicability across different contexts within a knowledge graph."

473,473,"- constrains
- constrain",constrain,Restricts,constrains,constrain,CESI,"The label ""constrain"" is the base form of the verb and therefore has the broadest semantic coverage, representing the action in a general sense. It is clear and applicable to various contexts where the action of constraining is being described, regardless of the subject's number (singular or plural). The base form is typically preferred in knowledge graphs for representing relationships because it can be universally applied. The label ""Restricts"" proposed by CoT is semantically similar but is a different verb that might not capture all the nuances of ""constrain."" The label ""constrains"" is the third-person singular present form of the verb, which is more specific and less generalizable than the base form."

It uses the verb ""intends,"" which is a more general form of ""aim at"" and ""is aimed to,"" thus covering the notion of purpose or goal that is present in both original phrases. Additionally, it includes ""within a context,"" which is a more concise way to express ""in the context of,"" and maintains the meaning of ""better isolating,"" by implying a targeted or specific action of isolation. This label is clear, concise, and maintains the semantic intent of the original phrases, making it the best choice for representing the relation in a knowledge graph."

It is clear and encompasses the idea of FDI income being related to, coming from, or being attributed to an entity. This label has broad semantic coverage as it can be applied to various contexts where FDI income is being discussed, whether it is incoming, outgoing, or simply being accounted for. It is also general enough to be applicable in different scenarios without losing its meaning. The CESI label ""attributes FDI income to"" is also a strong candidate but is slightly more specific in its implication of directionality. The EDC label ""FDI income in"" is less comprehensive as it does not necessarily imply the attribution aspect present in all the phrases."

It is broad enough to encompass a range of losses, from weekly percentage losses to record losses, while still highlighting the severity implied by words like ""largest"" and ""record."" The label is clear, concise, and has general applicability to various contexts where substantial losses are discussed.

It is broad enough to encompass the variations of the phrase while maintaining clarity. ""Is represented by"" could be a good alternative, but it changes the active voice found in the original phrases to a passive construction, which might slightly alter the intended meaning. Therefore, ""proxied by"" is the most direct and generalizable choice."

It indicates an ongoing or completed action of becoming longer, which is a common theme across all phrases. Unlike the alternatives ""lengthened on"" and ""lengthened in,"" which could imply a specific point in time or a particular context, ""Process of Lengthening"" abstracts the concept to encompass any scenario where lengthening occurs, making it the most broadly applicable label."

It is clear, specific, and maintains the original meaning of the phrases. The alternative ""Engaged in Transaction"" is less clear because it shifts the focus to the act of engagement rather than the purpose of use, which is a key aspect of the original phrases.

""Believed to be"" can be considered a passive form of ""believes,"" and thus they share the same semantic core. The addition of ""in"" in the CoT proposal (""Believes in"") introduces a preposition that may not be applicable in all contexts where the original phrases might be used, as it suggests a specific structure that requires an object of belief.

While ""incurred"" implies that the downturn was experienced or suffered, ""strive"" does not necessarily imply that the downturn was experienced; it could mean that there was an effort to avoid it. ""Faced"" is a more neutral term that can cover both experiencing and confronting an early downturn, thus providing a more inclusive representation of the two original phrases."

- stopped producing",stopped producing,"""Ceased Production""",stopped releasing by,"""Ceased Production""",CoT,"The label ""Ceased Production"" encompasses both ""stopped releasing by"" and ""stopped producing"" as it implies that the production or release of something has come to an end. It is clear and concise, and it covers the general idea behind both phrases without being too specific to one particular action (releasing or producing), making it broadly applicable to various contexts where production or release has been halted."
517,517,"- buy frequency
- review frequency
- purchase frequency",purchase frequency,Consumer Activity Frequency,buy frequency,Consumer Activity Frequency,CoT,"The label ""Consumer Activity Frequency"" encompasses all the activities related to a consumer's interaction with products or services, which includes buying, reviewing, and purchasing. It is broader than ""buy frequency"" and ""purchase frequency,"" which may not fully capture the concept of reviewing.

- first step is",in first step,"""First step in""",in first step,"""First step in""",CoT,"The label ""First step in"" captures the essence of initiation or the starting point within a sequence, which is the common thread among all the given phrases. It is clear and indicates that something is the initial part of a process or series of steps. This label also has broad semantic coverage as it can be applied to various contexts where a process or sequence is described. It is general enough to encompass the idea of being used in, being a part of, or constituting the first step. Additionally, it is phrased in an active form, which makes it versatile for different sentence constructions in knowledge graphs."
519,519,"- in second step
- use in second step of
- focus in second step",in second step,"""In the second step""",in second step,"""in second step""",CESI,"The label ""in second step"" is chosen because it maintains the core meaning shared by all the given phrases without adding additional words that may not be applicable in all contexts. The phrases ""use in second step of"" and ""focus in second step"" imply an action taking place in the second step, and the phrase ""in second step"" captures this notion of something occurring during the second step without specifying what that something is, thus providing broad semantic coverage. The label ""In the second step"" proposed by CoT includes the definite article ""the,"" which is not present in two of the original phrases and may not be necessary or applicable in all uses of the canonical label. Therefore, the label ""in second step"" is the most general and widely applicable choice."
520,520,"- exception in deterioration of
- exception in decline",exception in deterioration of,Exception in negative trend,exception in deterioration of,Exception in negative trend,CoT,"The chosen label ""Exception in negative trend"" captures the essence of both phrases ""exception in deterioration of"" and ""exception in decline"" as both phrases imply an exception to a general downward or negative progression. The term ""negative trend"" is broad enough to encompass various forms of decline or deterioration, making it semantically representative of the group. Additionally, the label is clear and can be generally applied across different contexts where a negative trend might be observed, thus ensuring its wide applicability."

- is exception in
- exceptions specified for
- is exception",is exception,'is an exception',exception to,"""exception to""",EDC,"The phrase ""exception to"" is the most clear and broadly applicable label that encompasses the semantic meaning of all the given phrases. It implies a relationship where something is an outlier or does not follow a general rule, which is the core idea conveyed by all the phrases listed. The preposition ""to"" indicates the directionality of the relationship, which is important for understanding the context in which the exception applies. The other options, ""'is an exception'"" and ""is exception,"" while similar, are less clear in their prepositional context and could be more ambiguous in a knowledge graph setting."
522,522,"- counter
- counters",counters,Counter,counter,counter,CoT,"The label ""counter"" is in its singular form, which is generally preferred for canonical labels as it represents the concept in a broad and basic form. This allows for easier generalization and application across different instances where the relation might be used. Both ""counter"" and ""counters"" refer to the same concept, but the singular form is more universally applicable and semantically clear, as it can represent both the singular and plural forms without confusion."

It is clear and concise, and the use of quotation marks by CoT indicates a standard representation of the phrase as a label. However, since the quotation marks are not necessary for the label itself and are more of a formatting choice, the best label is ""exempt from"" without the quotation marks, aligning with the CESI system's proposal. This version is grammatically correct and can be easily understood in various contexts where the exemption relation is applicable."
525,525,"- initiated work on
- initiated",initiated work on,Initiated,initiated work on,initiated,CoT,"The label ""initiated"" is the most broadly applicable and semantically covers both phrases. While ""initiated work on"" is more specific, it may not be necessary for all contexts where ""initiated"" could be applied.

It implies the introduction with the purpose of being a foundational element, which is a common theme across all the phrases. The label is clear, semantically broad, and can be generally applied to various contexts where something is being established as a fundamental component of a larger system or structure. It also maintains the active voice present in the original phrases, which is important for consistency in knowledge representation."

It is clear and directly states the action of decreasing, which is a common thread in all the phrases. The label also has broad semantic coverage as it can be applied to various contexts where operational hours are being reduced. It is more general and applicable than the other two options, which are more specific and could be seen as instances of the broader concept of decreasing operational hours."
529,529,"- assessed direction
- assessed path",assessed direction,Assessed Course,assessed direction,Assessed Course,CoT,"The term ""Assessed Course"" seems to encapsulate both the idea of an ""assessed direction"" and an ""assessed path,"" as both a direction and a path can be considered components of a course. The word ""course"" in this context suggests a planned or mapped-out route, which can be assessed. It is broad enough to cover various scenarios where the direction or path is being evaluated and is clear in its implication of assessment. While ""assessed direction"" is also a good fit, ""Assessed Course"" may offer slightly broader semantic coverage by encompassing the concept of a path as well."

- frequency",has frequency,"""Has frequency""",has frequency,"""has frequency""",CESI,"The label ""has frequency"" is clear, concise, and directly captures the essence of the relation phrases provided. It implies possession or association, which is applicable to all the given phrases. The use of lowercase for the first word makes it more general and not case-sensitive, which is preferable for a canonical label that may be used in various contexts within a knowledge graph. The inclusion of quotation marks by CoT is unnecessary for the label itself and does not add to the semantic clarity or coverage."
531,531,"- increased minimum wage level
- increased minimum wage by",increased minimum wage by,Raising the minimum wage,increased minimum wage level,Raising the minimum wage,CoT,"The label ""Raising the minimum wage"" is clear and encompasses the action described by both phrases ""increased minimum wage level"" and ""increased minimum wage by"". It is general enough to apply to various contexts where the minimum wage is being increased, without being overly specific about the method (by level or by a certain amount), thus providing broad semantic coverage."
532,532,"- Support Factor
- support factors",Support Factor,Support Factor,Support Factor,Support Factor,CoT,"All three systems have proposed the same label, ""Support Factor,"" which is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to the given phrases. The label accurately represents both ""Support Factor"" and ""support factors"" by capturing the singular form, which is commonly used to represent a category or concept in a canonical form. The capitalization of the first letters in ""Support Factor"" also aligns with the convention for naming entities or concepts, making it the best choice."
533,533,"- Ensure timely return to
- objective to ensure timely return of",Ensure timely return to,Ensure timely return of,Ensure timely return to,Ensure timely return of,CoT,"The phrase ""Ensure timely return of"" is more inclusive and semantically broad as it can cover scenarios where an object, item, or individual is being returned to a place or to someone's possession. The preposition ""of"" is generally used to indicate possession or belonging, which can apply to a wider range of contexts than ""to,"" which typically indicates direction or destination. Therefore, ""Ensure timely return of"" is a more versatile label that can encompass the meaning of the other phrase while maintaining clarity and general applicability."
534,534,"- conducting at a lower pace in
- lower pace than",conducting at a lower pace in,"""Operating at a slower pace than""",conducting at a lower pace in,"""Operating at a slower pace than""",CoT,"The label ""Operating at a slower pace than"" captures the essence of both phrases provided. It uses the word ""operating,"" which is a more general term than ""conducting"" and can apply to a wider range of scenarios. Additionally, ""at a slower pace than"" is a clearer and more common way to express the concept of being less rapid compared to something else, which encompasses both ""conducting at a lower pace in"" and ""lower pace than."" This label is broad enough to cover different contexts where the relation might be used, while still being specific enough to convey the intended meaning."
535,535,"- risk assessment
- risk assessment over",risk assessment,Risk Assessment,risk assessment,risk assessment,CESI,"The label ""risk assessment"" is clear, concise, and accurately represents the semantic meaning of both given phrases. It covers the broad concept without unnecessary prepositions or capitalization that may not apply in all contexts. Both CESI and EDC suggest this label, and it is also consistent with standard writing conventions where relation phrases are typically in lowercase unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. CoT's suggestion of ""Risk Assessment"" with capitalization does not add semantic value and is less general as it implies a title or a specific instance of a risk assessment."
536,536,"- increased risk by prospect of faster recovery
- increased by prospect of faster recovery",increased by prospect of faster recovery,"""Increase influenced by faster recovery""",increased risk by prospect of faster recovery,"""Increase influenced by faster recovery""",CoT,"This label captures the essence of both phrases by indicating that there is an increase, which is influenced by the prospect of a faster recovery. It is more general than the other two options, as it does not specify ""risk,"" which may not always be the subject of the increase, and it is clearer than the second option from CESI, which omits the cause-effect relationship implied by ""influenced by."" The CoT label is also more succinct and avoids redundancy, making it more applicable across different contexts where an increase is driven by the potential for faster recovery."
537,537,"- also written by

It covers the semantic meaning of ""also written by"" and ""written in"" (assuming ""written in"" refers to authorship rather than language or medium, which is not clear from the context). The label ""written by"" is clear and concise, and it is also in lowercase, which is more consistent with standard practices in knowledge representation. The label ""Written by"" proposed by CoT is semantically identical, but the use of initial capitalization is less conventional for relation phrases in knowledge graphs. Therefore, ""written by"" proposed by CESI is the best choice."
538,538,"- did not respond with
- refused to answer",refused to answer,Did not respond,did not respond with,Did not respond,CoT,"The label ""Did not respond"" captures the essence of both phrases ""did not respond with"" and ""refused to answer"" without being too specific. It covers the general idea of a lack of response, which is applicable to both initial phrases. It is also clear and concise, making it a suitable canonical label for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."
539,539,"- predicated on
- level predicated on",level predicated on,Based On,predicated on,Based On,CoT,"The label ""Based On"" has the broadest semantic coverage and is the most generally applicable term to represent the given phrases. Both ""predicated on"" and ""level predicated on"" imply a foundational or causal relationship that can be clearly and succinctly captured by the phrase ""Based On.""

540,540,"- summary measures can be found in
- provides a summary measure of",provides a summary measure of,"""provides or locates summary measures""",summary measures can be found in,"""provides or locates summary measures""",CoT,"This label encompasses both the action of providing a summary measure and the possibility of locating where summary measures can be found. It is broad enough to cover the semantics of both original phrases, implying that summary measures are either offered directly or can be found within a source. The other two options are more restrictive, with one focusing solely on the provision and the other on the location of summary measures. Therefore, the CoT proposal offers the most inclusive and general applicability."
541,541,"- allows deduction of
- allowed deduction",allows deduction of,Allows deduction,allows deduction of,allows deduction of,CESI,"The label ""allows deduction of"" maintains the original verb form ""allows"" and the preposition ""of,"" which is important for indicating the directionality of the relation (i.e., something allows the deduction of something else). It covers both the action ""allows"" and the concept of ""deduction,"" which are present in both phrases. The label proposed by CoT, ""Allows deduction,"" capitalizes the first word unnecessarily and drops the preposition ""of,"" which could lead to ambiguity in the relation's directionality. Therefore, ""allows deduction of"" is the most clear and semantically representative label of the given phrases."

It captures the essence of the other phrases well by indicating a lack of reaction, which is the key semantic component shared among the given phrases. The label also avoids the past tense and specific contexts implied by the other options, making it more universally applicable for representing the relation across various instances in a knowledge graph."

It encompasses the notion of saving, which is common to all the phrases, and specifies that it is a certain percentage of income, which is implied in the context of savings. The label is also general enough to apply to various scenarios where income is being allocated to savings, whether planned, favored, or found. The other two labels, ""saved percentage of"" and ""saved percentage of,"" offered by EDC and CESI respectively, are less descriptive and do not capture the forward-looking or planning aspect present in some of the original phrases such as ""planned to spend savings percentage."""

It captures the causal relationship implied in each phrase without specifying the degree or the specific circumstances of the saving, making it widely applicable.

It implies a process of gathering or collecting savings over time, which is a common thread among the given phrases. The term ""accumulation"" is more general and inclusive than ""held as"" or ""accumulated by,"" which can imply a more static state or a specific action by an individual. ""Accumulation of Savings"" also has a formal tone that is appropriate for a canonical label in a knowledge graph, and it avoids the potential ambiguity of who is doing the accumulating or holding, making it broadly applicable."

This makes it clear, broadly semantic, and generally applicable to all instances of the relation phrases provided, regardless of the specific country involved. The labels from EDC and CESI are too specific, as they only reference the US, which does not accurately represent the other phrases that mention Switzerland and the UK."
548,548,"- jumps by
- jumped in
- jumped to",jumped to,Jumps to,jumps by,"""jumps to""",CoT,"The label ""jumps to"" is in the present tense, which generally allows for broader semantic coverage and is more timeless than past tense forms. It also captures the sense of movement or transition from one state or place to another, which is a common theme in all the given phrases. While ""jumps by"" could imply passing something without stopping, ""jumps to"" more accurately encompasses the idea of moving towards a target or into a new state, which can be inferred from the other phrases ""jumped in"" and ""jumped to."" Therefore, ""jumps to"" is the most representative and generally applicable label."
549,549,"- marginal negative effect due to

It maintains clarity while ensuring broad semantic coverage and general applicability to various contexts where the relationship might be used."

It is clear, concise, and has broad semantic coverage that accurately reflects the meaning of the original phrases without being too specific to a particular context. It also avoids the potential ambiguity of ""not needed for,"" which could imply lack of necessity beyond the context of a requirement.

It covers the broad semantic meaning of funds or resources coming into a system, which is applicable to all the given phrases. It avoids the preposition 'in' used in ""inflows in,"" which could imply a location rather than an action or state, and it is more grammatically complete than the label with quotation marks (""Has Inflow"") provided by CoT. The EDC label is the most neutral and widely applicable of the three."
553,553,"- shares characteristics with
- has commonality with",shares characteristics with,Shares common features with,shares characteristics with,Shares common features with,CoT,"The phrase ""Shares common features with"" encompasses both the idea of sharing characteristics and having commonality. It is broad enough to cover various aspects that might be shared between entities, such as physical attributes, behaviors, or abstract properties, and it is clear and easily understandable. While ""shares characteristics with"" is also a good candidate, ""Shares common features with"" is slightly more inclusive as ""features"" can be interpreted as both characteristics and commonalities, thus providing the widest semantic coverage and general applicability."
554,554,"- becomes accentuated at
- accentuated by",becomes accentuated at,Is accentuated by,becomes accentuated at,Is accentuated by,CoT,"The phrase ""Is accentuated by"" is more general and broadly applicable as it does not imply a temporal aspect (""becomes"") and can be used to represent both a state and an action.

It captures the essence of financial access being granted without limiting the scope to a particular type of financial metric.

The term ""quantity"" can refer to both the magnitude of something (size) and the count of discrete units (number). This label is more inclusive and represents a broader semantic coverage of the given phrases, making it a more suitable canonical label for the relations in question."

It is broader and more descriptive than ""did not recover,"" which is more specific to a single event and does not necessarily imply the ongoing nature of the condition. Therefore, the CoT label is more inclusive and representative of the given phrases."

It covers the broad semantic range of the given phrases, which all relate to the act of obtaining or needing funds from the RRF (Recovery and Resilience Facility or similar fund). It is general enough to encompass the various ways entities might interact with the funding (being required to have it, being a major recipient, or simply receiving it), yet specific enough to clearly indicate the nature of the relationship, which is centered around the reception of funds. The other options, ""RRF funding activities"" and ""required by RRF,"" are either too broad or too narrow to accurately represent all the given phrases."

It implies both the state of being in a market and the act of entering a market. The phrases ""in market,"" ""entering the market,"" ""in markets,"" and ""entered market status"" all suggest a company or product's existence within a market, whether they are currently established or just beginning to enter. ""Market Presence"" captures the essence of these activities without being too specific to one particular action (such as just entering), and it avoids the potential confusion of singular versus plural forms (""market"" vs. ""markets"")."
561,561,"- shortly before raising
- shortly before",shortly before raising,Immediately before,shortly before raising,"""shortly before""",Other,"The label ""shortly before"" is more inclusive and general than ""shortly before raising,"" as it does not limit the context to the action of raising. It captures the temporal proximity implied by both phrases without being overly specific. The label ""Immediately before"" suggested by CoT changes the meaning slightly, as ""immediately"" suggests no delay, while ""shortly"" allows for a brief, yet unspecified, amount of time. Therefore, ""shortly before"" is the best choice for its clarity and broad semantic coverage that accurately represents the given phrases."
562,562,"- nature is
- nature of

- has nature",has nature of,"""characteristics""",nature is,"""has nature of""",CESI,"The label ""has nature of"" encompasses the idea that an entity possesses certain characteristics or qualities, which is a common thread among the given phrases. It is clear and directly reflects the relationship between an entity and its inherent properties. The label is also broad enough to cover various contexts where these phrases might be used in a knowledge graph, ensuring general applicability. While ""characteristics"" is a good summary, it is a noun rather than a relational phrase, which may not fit as well in the structure of a knowledge graph. ""Nature is"" is less specific and could imply a definition rather than a possession of qualities. Therefore, ""has nature of"" strikes a balance between specificity and coverage."

The label ""Demonstrating a loss in"" proposed by CoT changes the tense and adds a level of formality that is not present in the original phrases, which could potentially narrow its applicability. Therefore, ""showed losses in"" is the most suitable canonical label."

It covers the semantics of both ""conducted survey"" and ""conducted survey in"" without the need for prepositions, which may not be necessary for the canonical form. The label ""Conducting Survey"" from CoT is in the present continuous tense, which might not accurately represent past or future surveys.

It encompasses the idea that something is being modeled after something else, which is a common theme in the given phrases. ""Models for"" is more ambiguous as it could imply purpose rather than the act of modeling. ""Due to model of"" is more specific and suggests causality, which is not as universally applicable as ""modeled by."" Therefore, ""modeled by"" is the best choice for its clarity and broad semantic coverage, as it can be applied to various scenarios where something serves as a model for something else."

It is general enough to apply to various contexts where the specific details of the meeting (such as the exact location or month) are not as important as the fact that a meeting has been scheduled for the near future.

It is clear, concise, and has broad semantic coverage, as it can be used to represent both literal feeding and metaphorical input or influence. The choice of ""feeds into"" over ""feeds through to"" is due to its more general applicability and common usage. The variations with ""through"" suggest a process of passing through something before reaching a destination, which may not always be implied in the context of these phrases.

The term ""amount"" is sufficiently broad to encompass both specific proportions and total quantities, making it a versatile choice that can be applied generally across different contexts within a knowledge graph. The other options, ""Asset Holdings Quantity"" and ""holdings proportion of,"" are either too specific or imply a subset of the meaning conveyed by all the phrases. ""Asset Holdings Quantity"" introduces the word ""Asset,"" which is not present in the original phrases and may not always be applicable, while ""holdings proportion of"" focuses only on the proportional aspect and not the total amount."

It is also in lowercase, which is more consistent with standard conventions in knowledge graphs where relation phrases are typically not capitalized unless they are proper nouns. Both CESI and EDC proposed this label, suggesting a consensus on its suitability. CoT's ""Average Holding"" uses title case and the singular form, which might imply a more limited scope.

The use of the infinitive ""to remove"" rather than the noun ""removal"" makes it more broadly applicable to different contexts where the action might be described.

It is clear and broadly applicable to various scenarios where items, ideas, or proposals are brought to attention earlier than planned. While 'brought forward' is also a good candidate, it is a bit more ambiguous and could imply physical movement.

- suppressed
- may hide
- suppressed by",suppress,Suppresses,may suppress,Suppresses,CoT,"The label ""Suppresses"" captures the active, present-tense form of the verb, which is more general and broadly applicable than the conditional ""may suppress."" It also reflects the action described by all the phrases more accurately than the base form ""suppress,"" which could be interpreted as an imperative or an infinitive, thus potentially narrowing its semantic coverage. ""Suppresses"" encompasses both the action and the ongoing effect, which is relevant to all the given phrases."
675,675,"- output change in
- change in output",output change in,Change in output,output change in,Change in output,CoT,"The phrase ""Change in output"" is grammatically correct and clearly conveys the idea that there is a variation or modification in the output. It is broad and applicable to various contexts where the output can be of different natures (e.g., production, computation, results). The capitalization of the first letter is not essential for the semantic representation but does not detract from its clarity or applicability. The phrase ""output change in"" seems incomplete and less natural in language use. Therefore, ""Change in output"" is the best label among the given options."
676,676,"- smallest change in trust in
- shows small difference in trust levels in",smallest change in trust in,Minor fluctuation in trust level,smallest change in trust in,Minor fluctuation in trust level,CoT,"The chosen label ""Minor fluctuation in trust level"" captures the essence of both phrases given, which describe a small variation in the degree of trust. It uses more general terms like ""minor fluctuation"" and ""trust level,"" which are broadly applicable and semantically cover the specifics of ""smallest change"" and ""small difference."" This label is also clearer as it avoids repetition and is succinct, making it suitable for a canonical representation in a knowledge graph."
677,677,"- had net trust level in
- had net trust level of",had net trust level of,"""Has net trust level of""",had net trust level in,"""Has net trust level of""",CoT,"The chosen label uses the present tense ""Has"" which is generally more applicable and timeless for canonical labels in knowledge graphs, as it does not confine the relation to a past event. Additionally, the preposition ""of"" is more grammatically correct in this context, as it typically follows the noun ""level"" when indicating the degree or amount of something (in this case, trust). Therefore, ""Has net trust level of"" is the most appropriate choice as it provides a clear and semantically accurate representation of the relationship between entities with respect to their trust level."
678,678,"- ending action
- ending action affects",ending action affects,Action Conclusion and Impact,ending action,Action Conclusion and Impact,CoT,"The label ""Action Conclusion and Impact"" encompasses both the concept of an action ending and the effects that the ending action has. It is clear and descriptive, providing a broad semantic coverage that aptly represents both phrases ""ending action"" and ""ending action affects."" It also has general applicability to various contexts where the conclusion of an action and its subsequent impacts are relevant. The other options, ""ending action affects"" and ""ending action,"" are more limited in scope, with the former focusing only on the effects and the latter only on the conclusion of the action without acknowledging the effects."

It is also clear and concise, making it easily understandable and applicable to a wide range of scenarios where trust levels are discussed. The other labels, ""Comparative Higher Trust Level"" and ""time of higher trust,"" imply specific conditions (comparative and temporal, respectively) that may not apply to all the given phrases."

It is clear and encompasses the idea of similarity in trust, which is a common theme across all the phrases. The use of ""exhibits"" is a more formal verb that implies a demonstration or display, which can be applicable in a variety of contexts within a knowledge graph. Additionally, the phrase ""as"" suggests a comparison, which is a necessary component of the original phrases. Overall, it provides a broad semantic coverage and is generally applicable to the relations described by the original phrases."

It indicates a temporal aspect related to the act of importing, which is the common theme in the given phrases. The word ""higher"" in ""higher imports time"" seems to be an outlier that does not contribute to the core meaning of the relation, and ""time of import"" is slightly less natural in phrasing compared to ""Import time"".

It is broad enough to cover various scenarios that could be described by the given phrases, and it implies both the impact of the crisis and the time frame, which makes it a more inclusive and representative label for the group of relation phrases. The other two options are more limited in scope, with ""during crisis"" focusing only on the timing and ""affected by crisis"" emphasizing the impact without necessarily indicating the temporal aspect."

It covers the 'where from' aspect (importing from), the 'source' aspect (imports source), the 'between' aspect (imports between), the 'why' aspect (import due to, reason for import), and the initiation of the action (started importing). The other two labels, ""importing from,"" are too narrow as they primarily focus on the source or origin aspect of importing, without capturing the reasons or the broader context of the import activity."

It captures the essence of all three phrases by including any entity (subject or location) that could be associated with manufacturing imports. It also adds clarity by specifying that it's not just any imports, but specifically manufacturing imports, which aligns well with the given phrases. The other two labels, ""subject of manufacturing imports"" and ""subject of imports,"" are more restrictive and less clear, as they do not account for the location aspect that is present in one of the phrases."

The label ""deliver on"" is clear, concise, and directly reflects the semantics of the given phrases without adding unnecessary specificity. ""Deliver on a commitment"" by CoT is more specific and may not cover all possible uses of the phrase (e.g., delivering on a promise, an expectation, a goal, etc.). Therefore, the simplest and most broadly applicable label is ""deliver on,"" which is proposed by both EDC and CESI. Since EDC and CESI proposed the same label, it is chosen for its clarity and general applicability."
690,690,"- imposed by
- Imposed by",imposed by,imposed by,imposed by,"""imposed by""",EDC,"All three candidate labels are identical and accurately represent the given relation phrases. Since there is no variation between the labels, any of them would serve as a suitable canonical label. The phrase ""imposed by"" clearly conveys the meaning of an action or rule being applied by an authority or agent, which is semantically aligned with the given phrases. Therefore, the choice is based on the correctness and semantic alignment of the label with the phrases, rather than any differences between the labels, as there are none."
691,691,"- imposed
- imposed on",imposed,"""Imposed on""",imposed,"""Imposed on""",CoT,"The phrase ""imposed on"" is more explicit and semantically complete, as it implies an action being applied to an object or subject. The word ""imposed"" alone could be interpreted as more ambiguous because it lacks the preposition that indicates the direction or target of the imposition. Therefore, ""Imposed on"" covers the semantic meaning of both phrases more accurately and is clearer in its application within a knowledge graph context."

It provides a broad semantic coverage that accurately reflects the variety of interactions with recommendations represented in the original phrases. While ""issued recommendations to"" is common to several phrases, it does not capture the responding or agreeing aspects present in the others. Therefore, the CoT label is the most inclusive and representative of the group."
693,693,"- potentially open up
- opening up since
- opened up",opened up,Opening up,potentially open up,Opening up,CoT,"The label ""Opening up"" captures the essence of the action being described in all the given phrases. It is a present continuous form that implies an ongoing process, which can easily encompass both the potentiality of ""potentially open up"" and the completed action ""opened up."" It is also more general than ""opened up,"" which is past tense and may not fully represent the potential or ongoing nature of ""potentially open up"" and ""opening up since."" Therefore, ""Opening up"" has the broadest semantic coverage and is the most applicable to different contexts where the relation might be used."

The phrases ""expires after,"" ""started to expire,"" ""expected to expire after,"" and ""expired in"" all imply a specific time at which something ceases to be valid or in effect. The label ""Expires at a specific time"" is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to various contexts where these phrases might be used. It also avoids the ambiguity of the phrase ""expires after,"" which could imply a duration rather than a specific point in time."

- balance of risks",balance of risks,Balancing Risks,balances of risks,balance of risks,CESI,"The phrase ""balance of risks"" is grammatically correct and semantically broad enough to encompass the various ways in which the concept of risk balancing is expressed in the given phrases. It implies a consideration of multiple risks and the act of balancing them, which is a common theme across all the phrases. Additionally, it avoids the progressive tense used in ""Balancing Risks,"" which may not be as universally applicable, and it is more concise and less redundant than ""balances of risks,"" making it a more effective canonical label."
696,696,"- targets not reached by

It generalizes the concept of not achieving a goal, which is implied by each of the original phrases. The chosen label avoids the passive construction found in ""targets not reached by"" and ""entails not reaching target by,"" and it also simplifies the more complex structure of ""entails not reaching."" By focusing on the failure to reach a target, it maintains broad semantic coverage and is applicable to a wide range of scenarios where a target or goal is not met."
697,697,"- has relationship change with

It implies a purpose or reason for the grant, which could encompass the context of ""to"" (the recipient), ""on"" (a specific occasion), and ""during"" (a particular time frame). The other options, ""granted under"" and ""granted to,"" are more specific and might not cover all instances as effectively. ""Granted under"" suggests a condition or authority, which is not as universally applicable, and ""granted to"" focuses solely on the recipient, excluding the aspect of purpose or timing."

- detail location",detailed information location,Detailed Location Information,detailed information location,Detailed Location Information,CoT,"The label ""Detailed Location Information"" captures the essence of both phrases by emphasizing the specificity (""Detailed"") and the content (""Location Information"") in a way that is clear and grammatically coherent. It also maintains broad semantic coverage by including both the concept of detail and location information, and it is generally applicable as a canonical label for relations in a knowledge graph that refer to specific information about a location. The other two labels proposed by CESI and EDC are less clear because they do not follow standard English phrasing, which might lead to ambiguity or confusion."

It is more general than ""not driven only by,"" which implies that there may be other driving factors, and it is clearer and more direct than ""Not influenced by,"" which could be interpreted more broadly and does not necessarily convey the same sense of active driving force implied by ""driven."" Therefore, ""not driven by"" offers the best clarity and semantic coverage for the group of phrases."

It captures the essence of the relation phrases without being tied to a specific tense, making it suitable for representing past, present, and continuous aspects of the action. It is also clear and concise, which is beneficial for a canonical label in a knowledge graph. The double quotes around ""Lagging behind"" in CoT's proposal are unnecessary for the label itself, and the CESI and EDC proposals include tense, which could limit their applicability."
703,703,"- lagged

It is phrased as a question, which is not ideal for a canonical label in a knowledge graph, but it does cover the semantic meaning of both phrases more completely than the other options. It implies a measurement (inflation rate) that is relevant to both import and producer prices, thus providing clarity and broad semantic coverage. The other two options are more specific to either import price inflation (CESI) or import and producer prices without mentioning inflation (EDC), making them less comprehensive."

It is general enough to apply to various contexts where producer price inflation is a factor, yet it remains clear in its reference to the relationship between entities and producer price inflation. The other two labels, ""is producer price inflation metric for"" and ""has producer price inflation of,"" are more specific and may not cover all instances implied by the given phrases, such as ""has producer price pressures"" or ""is the producer price inflation for domestic sales of,"" which are not strictly about having a metric or inflation of a specific amount but could be related to the concept in a broader sense."

The other two candidate labels, ""tightening credit standards on,"" are more limited as they primarily suggest an action but do not explicitly include the expectation aspect, which is present in some of the original phrases. Therefore, the CoT label provides the broadest semantic coverage and general applicability to represent all the given relation phrases."
711,711,"- delays could destabilize
- could potentially destabilize",could potentially destabilize,Delays may lead to instability,delays could destabilize,Delays may lead to instability,CoT,"This label captures the essence of both phrases by indicating a possibility (""may"") and a result (""lead to instability""), which is a broader and more general way to describe the potential outcome of ""destabilize."" It also avoids the redundancy of ""potentially"" found in the second phrase, making it more concise. Additionally, it uses the more general term ""instability,"" which can encompass various forms of destabilization, thus providing broad semantic coverage."

It implies the possibility of causing a disruption, which is the core idea shared by all the phrases. It is also neutral in terms of perspective, not specifying who or what might cause the derailment, making it more universally applicable. The other options, ""could potentially derail"" and ""could be derailed by,"" include additional words that do not add significant meaning and are more verbose.

""Fluctuates around"" implies a central point rather than a range, and ""fluctuate in range"" is less clear and grammatically awkward compared to the chosen label. ""Fluctuates within a range"" clearly communicates that there is a spectrum or scope of fluctuation, which is semantically inclusive of both ""fluctuate in range"" and ""fluctuates around."""

It captures the idea of being at the end or bottom of a ranking or scale, which is a broader and more universally applicable interpretation than the more literal ""last as low.""

It is clear and provides a broad semantic coverage that applies to situations where something is produced within a location as well as when it is not. Both ""produced within"" and ""not produced within"" are specific cases of the general ""Production Location Status"".

722,722,"- channeled by
- channeled towards",channeled towards,"""Directed towards""",channeled by,"""channeled towards""",CESI,"The phrase ""channeled towards"" encompasses the idea of directionality and purpose, which is implicit in both ""channeled by"" and ""channeled towards."" It suggests that something is being directed or funneled towards a particular end or recipient, which can apply whether the channeling is done by an agent or towards a target. The phrase ""Directed towards"" is also a good fit semantically, but it is slightly less specific than ""channeled towards,"" which carries the additional connotation of guidance or transmission, often found in the context of resources, efforts, or attention. ""channeled by"" is more agent-focused and does not as clearly capture the directional aspect when the agent is not specified. Therefore, ""channeled towards"" strikes a balance between clarity and semantic coverage for the given phrases."

It captures the essence of the action (disbursement), the subject (funds), and implies a process, which can include various aspects such as the date, amount, and conditions of disbursement. ""Disbursed to"" and ""disbursed"" are more specific and do not convey the full semantic range of the phrases provided, such as ""date of disbursement"" or ""amount disbursed,"" which are integral parts of the disbursement process."

It is clear and covers the broad semantic range of the activities described by all the given phrases.

CESI's and EDC's proposals are too specific, as they only refer to a single month, which does not cover all the given phrases.

The label ""experienced trend"" directly matches one of the phrases and is the closest in reflecting the past participle form that can imply both an ongoing or completed action, providing a broad semantic coverage. The alternative label ""Observing a trend"" proposed by CoT introduces a different verb (""observing"") which, while semantically similar, does not match the given phrases as closely as ""experienced trend."" Therefore, ""experienced trend"" is chosen for its direct match and semantic alignment with the given phrases."

It is clear and encompasses the idea of repaying with some conditions or terms implied, which is a commonality in both original phrases. The term ""amounts"" in the first label from EDC is more specific and may not be necessary for a canonical label that needs to cover a range of similar phrases. The second label proposed by CoT, ""Repaying under terms,"" adds the word ""terms,"" which is not present in the original phrases and might narrow the scope or imply specificity that is not warranted.

It covers the semantic meaning of all the variations by focusing on the core action of repayment and the object of that action. ""Repayment Process"" suggested by CoT is broader and could imply the entire process of repayment rather than the specific action or instance of repayment, which is less precise in this context.

It captures the essence of the action without specifying the direction or recipient, which makes it semantically inclusive of all variations. The label ""send to"" is slightly more specific and may not be as generalizable, as it implies a direction, which is not always necessary to understand the basic action of sending. Therefore, ""send"" is the best choice for a canonical label."

The other options, ""calibrated for"" and ""calibrate,"" are more restrictive and represent only a subset of the possible semantic uses of the term.

It is a more general and widely understood term that captures the essence of the relation phrases while maintaining clarity and applicability across different contexts. The other two options are more specific and could be seen as instances of income distribution, but they do not cover the semantic range as effectively as ""Income distribution."""

The other options, ""outweighing"" and ""may outweigh,"" include a continuous aspect and a modal verb, respectively, which might not be as universally applicable to all given phrases.

The choice of lowercase is consistent with general writing conventions for relation phrases in knowledge graphs, where such labels are typically not capitalized unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. Therefore, the label proposed by both EDC and CESI is the most appropriate. CoT's suggestion is semantically identical but uses an unnecessary capitalization."

""Triggered to Activate"" introduces the word ""triggered,"" which is not present in the original phrases and may imply a slightly different meaning. ""Activated by"" maintains the passive construction present in most of the phrases and can be broadly applied to different contexts where one thing is activated by another, whether it is a counteraction, a condition, or a direct cause."

It is broad enough to encompass various degrees of impediment, which can include being held back, stalled, or halted. This makes it a more universally applicable label for the given relation phrases, as it implies an interruption or hindrance to recovery without being overly specific about the nature or duration of the obstruction."
750,750,"- stable estimated rate
- stable rate",stable rate,Stable Rate,stable estimated rate,stable rate,CESI,"The label ""stable rate"" is the most inclusive and broadly applicable term that captures the essence of both phrases. It is clear and concise, and the term ""estimated"" in ""stable estimated rate"" can be seen as redundant since rates are often understood to be estimates or subject to change. The capitalization in ""Stable Rate"" from CoT does not add semantic value and is not necessary for a canonical label. Therefore, ""stable rate"" from CESI is the best choice."

The word ""sharp"" is common to all phrases and conveys the severity of the drop, while ""drop"" is a more commonly used term than ""fall"" in the context of decreases, making it more broadly applicable. The label by CoT, ""Saw a significant drop in,"" while also accurate, introduces the word ""significant"" which is not present in the original phrases and may slightly alter the meaning. Therefore, ""saw sharp drop in"" is the most accurate and generalizable label."

It maintains the core meaning without being overly specific (e.g., the inclusion of ""of"" in the other options), which allows for general applicability across different contexts where the loss might not be of something but rather for someone or something. It is also clear and concise, which is beneficial for a canonical label in a knowledge graph."

It is clear and has broad semantic coverage, as it can apply to various contexts where something is being reduced or mitigated. The phrases ""helps attenuate,"" ""attenuated by,"" and ""possibly attenuated"" all suggest a diminishing effect, which is directly encapsulated by the proposed CoT label. This label also avoids the passive voice found in ""attenuated by"" and is more inclusive than ""helps attenuate,"" which implies assistance rather than the direct action of diminishing."
760,760,"- continues to be key factor in

It is clear, broad in semantic coverage, and can be generally applied to various scenarios where something continues to be important or influential. The word ""maintains"" reflects the continuity aspect, ""significant"" covers the importance, and ""role in"" suggests the area of influence, making it a comprehensive representation of the given phrases."

It implies current relevance and is broad enough to encompass both past and present situations, as well as the influence aspect mentioned in one of the variants. Additionally, it avoids the past tense ""was,"" which could unnecessarily restrict the temporal scope of the relation."
762,762,"- R characteristic of
- R structural characteristic of",R characteristic of,R has characteristic of,R characteristic of,R characteristic of,EDC,"The label ""R characteristic of"" is concise and encompasses the broad semantic meaning of both given phrases. It implies that there is a characteristic that belongs to or is a defining feature of something, which is applicable to both general and structural characteristics. The inclusion of ""structural"" in one of the phrases is a specific type of characteristic, which still falls under the broader category of ""characteristic."" Therefore, this label is the most inclusive and generalizable for representing the given relation phrases. The label ""R has characteristic of"" proposed by CoT is also accurate but is slightly more verbose and the inclusion of ""has"" does not significantly add to the semantic clarity or coverage."

- MoreResilientThan",MoreVolatileThan,SuperiorInAttribute,MoreImportantThan,SuperiorInAttribute,CoT,"The label ""SuperiorInAttribute"" is the most general and encompasses the idea that one entity possesses a certain quality to a greater extent than another, without specifying what that quality is. This broad semantic coverage allows it to represent a range of comparative relations, such as importance, volatility, and resilience, making it the most applicable label for all the given phrases. The other two options, ""MoreVolatileThan"" and ""MoreImportantThan,"" are too specific as they only accurately describe one of the three phrases each."

It is broad enough to encompass both the specificity of having seen a positive change and the more general concept of an average annual rate of change. By omitting the qualifier ""positive"" and the verb ""seen,"" the label maintains generality and applicability to a wider range of potential rates of change, not just positive ones. This makes it more inclusive and representative of the semantic similarity between the given phrases."
767,767,"- synonym for

It is also the root form of the verb, making it a more general and inclusive term that can encompass the different variations of the word (e.g., emphasises, emphasized) and phrases related to the act of emphasizing. Additionally, it aligns with standard American English spelling, which is commonly used in international and computational contexts."

This label encompasses the idea that one thing is the underlying support or the starting point for another, which is a common thread among the given phrases. It is also in present tense, which generally works well for canonical labels in knowledge graphs as it implies an ongoing or timeless relationship. The label is broad enough to cover different variations of the phrase while maintaining the core meaning. The use of the singular verb ""provides"" rather than ""provided"" makes it more general and not tied to a specific time, enhancing its applicability across various contexts."
770,770,"- post

- posts",post,Post,post,post,EDC,"The label ""post"" is in lowercase, which is generally more appropriate for canonical labels in a knowledge graph as they are not typically case-sensitive and do not usually start with a capital letter unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. Both EDC and CESI proposed ""post,"" which is the base form of the verb and covers the action described by all the given phrases semantically. The label from CoT, ""Post,"" has an unnecessary capitalization which might imply a proper noun or a specific product name rather than the general action of posting.

It is clear and general enough to cover various scenarios that could be described by the original phrases. Additionally, it avoids the variations in spelling (materialise/materialize) and prepositions (due to/from/in), making it more universally applicable and understandable."
772,772,"- affected by conflict
- is affected in war with",is affected in war with,Impacted by conflict,affected by conflict,Impacted by conflict,CoT,"The label ""Impacted by conflict"" is the most inclusive and general term that can cover various types of conflicts, not just war. It also implies a broader range of effects, similar to ""affected by conflict,"" but with a slightly more formal tone. ""Is affected in war with"" is too specific as it only refers to war, while ""affected by conflict"" and ""Impacted by conflict"" can represent a wider range of situations where conflict is present, not limited to war scenarios. ""Impacted by conflict"" is chosen over ""affected by conflict"" because ""impacted"" can be seen as a more encompassing term that implies a significant effect, which is often the case in situations described by these phrases."
773,773,"- materialised in
- materialise in
- materialize through",materialise in,Materialize in,materialised in,Materialize in,CoT,"The label ""Materialize in"" is chosen because it captures the essence of the action in a present tense, which is more general and applicable to a broader range of scenarios. It implies an ongoing or potential process rather than one that has already occurred, as ""materialised in"" would suggest. Moreover, it uses the more common American spelling ""materialize"" which is often preferred in international contexts, but this choice may depend on the specific audience or standard of the knowledge graph.

It is also in the past participle form, which is consistent with the phrases ""more anchored in"" and ""anchored in,"" indicating a state of being. The label ""anchor"" provided by EDC is too general and does not reflect the state of being anchored, while CoT's ""'Anchored in Context'"" is unnecessarily specific and includes additional context that is not present in all the original phrases.

It has broad semantic coverage, as it can be easily understood to encompass the possession of an attitude by an entity towards another. It is also generally applicable to various contexts without the need for additional words, making it the most straightforward representation of the given phrases. The inclusion of ""has"" in ""has attitudes towards"" is redundant for a canonical label, and ""Holds attitude towards"" adds an unnecessary verb that does not enhance understanding."

It is clear and general enough to be applicable in various contexts where the action of making something different is implied. The word ""alter"" in its verb form can be specific to the act of making a small change, especially in the context of adjusting clothing, whereas ""Change"" is more universally understood as making something different, which encompasses the meaning of ""alter"" and ""alters"" without being context-specific."

It maintains clarity and general applicability without limiting the scope to a particular type of lending rate.

It is also in lowercase, which is a common convention for canonical labels in knowledge graphs, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential confusion that may arise from case-sensitive matching. The label from CESI and EDC is identical, and either could serve as the best label, but since we have to choose one, the label ""implements policy for"" is selected without regard to the source."

It implies that flexibility is a part of the subject, which is common to all the phrases. The word ""involves"" is more inclusive and general than ""includes,"" which can imply a subset or a component, whereas ""involves"" suggests a broader relationship.

""Uses approach for"" and ""used approach"" both imply that an approach is being utilized, and the label ""uses approach"" captures this core idea succinctly. The label ""Implements Strategy"" proposed by CoT introduces a new term ""strategy"" which may not be semantically identical to ""approach"" and could potentially narrow the meaning. Additionally, ""uses approach for"" suggested by EDC includes ""for"" which may not be applicable in all contexts, especially when the phrase doesn't specify a particular purpose or goal.

It reflects clarity and broad semantic coverage, making it applicable to a variety of situations that the original phrases might represent. Both ""CoT: Amid"" and ""EDC: amid"" suggest the same word, but the ""CoT"" version includes unnecessary capitalization, which could imply a proper noun or a specific use case, thus ""amid"" from both EDC and CESI is preferable.

This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage by addressing both price and inflation aspects, and is generally applicable to contexts where financial stability is discussed.

It is also in the passive voice, which is more inclusive and representative of the relationship from the perspective of the subject being surrounded.

The term ""Initiated"" proposed by CoT, while similar, does not capture the full nuance of ""launched,"" which often implies a more formal or public beginning, especially in the context of products, services, or initiatives.

It implies the date something comes into effect, which can be understood as the approval date or the new effect date. ""Approval date"" is too specific, as not all effective dates are necessarily approval dates. ""Effective Start Date"" is clear but slightly more verbose and the word ""start"" may not be necessary since ""effective date"" generally implies the beginning of something's effectiveness. Therefore, ""effective date"" strikes a balance between clarity and semantic coverage."

It retains the core meaning of being not affected, which is the primary relation expressed in each phrase. The specificity of ""in terms of"" or ""pandemic"" in some phrases is context-dependent and not necessary to capture the general relation.

It is broad enough to encompass the variations of the phrase and is the most suitable for representing the semantic similarity of the group. The labels from EDC and CESI are identical and both fit these criteria, but the CoT label includes unnecessary quotation marks which do not add value and could potentially cause confusion in a knowledge graph context.

It covers the meaning of being ""found in series"" as well, since if something is part of a series, it is inherently found within that series. The capitalization in ""Part of series"" from CoT is not necessary for the canonical label as it is not a proper noun or the beginning of a sentence, and ""found in series"" from EDC seems slightly less direct in conveying the relationship. Therefore, ""part of series"" from CESI is the best choice as it is clear, semantically inclusive, and grammatically appropriate for a canonical label."

It maintains the order of the original phrases, which suggests that the differences are the outcome of the cause.

The preposition ""by"" is essential as it denotes the direction of the motivation, which is a key aspect of the semantic meaning shared by all the given phrases.

It maintains clarity by specifying that it is the initial occurrence and uses a more general term ""outbreak"" which can be applied to various contexts. The phrase ""compared with first wave in"" implies a relationship to the initial outbreak, so the chosen label still captures the essence of comparison by indicating the point of reference is the initial outbreak."

- According to",according to,According to,according to,"""according to""",CESI,"The label ""according to"" is the most appropriate choice as it is in lowercase, which is generally more inclusive and flexible for different contexts in a knowledge graph. It avoids potential issues with case sensitivity and is consistent with the standard practice of using lowercase for programming and data representation. The capitalization in ""According to"" from CoT is unnecessary and could imply that it is the start of a sentence or a proper noun, which is not the case here.

It also includes the word ""continue,"" which is essential to convey the meaning of ongoing action that is present in both phrases. The label proposed by CoT, ""Asked to continue work,"" changes ""working"" to ""work,"" which slightly shifts the meaning and may not capture the continuous aspect implied by the gerund form. Therefore, the label ""asked to continue working"" is the most representative and semantically inclusive of the given relation phrases."
934,934,"- adjustable across
- can be adjusted flexibly across",adjustable across,Adjustable across,adjustable across,adjustable across,CoT,"The phrase ""adjustable across"" captures the essence of both provided phrases while maintaining clarity and broad semantic coverage. It is succinct and general enough to apply to various contexts where the relation might be used. The phrase ""can be adjusted flexibly across"" is a more verbose version of the same concept, and thus the simpler form is preferable for a canonical label. The capitalization in ""Adjustable across"" from CoT is unnecessary as labels typically do not require capitalization unless denoting proper nouns or at the beginning of sentences. Therefore, the label from EDC and CESI is more appropriate, and between them, since they are identical, any could be chosen. However, as per the instruction to not choose based on order, I have simply copied the label as presented in the question."

- set out in
- sets on",sets out,Initiates a task or journey,sets out,Initiates a task or journey,CoT,"The phrases 'sets out,' 'set out in,' and 'sets on' all imply the beginning or initiation of an action or journey. The label ""Initiates a task or journey"" captures the essence of starting something new, which is a common thread among the given phrases. It is clearer and more descriptive than the more ambiguous ""sets out,"" which could be interpreted in multiple ways and does not fully encompass the idea of initiation implied by all the phrases. Therefore, ""Initiates a task or journey"" is the best choice for its clarity and comprehensive semantic coverage."

It is written in lowercase, which is generally more inclusive and adaptable for various contexts within a knowledge graph. The CESI and EDC proposals are identical, but the CoT proposal introduces unnecessary capitalization, which could imply specificity or formality that may not be universally applicable.

- dominant source of money creation",dominance in money creation in,Dominant in money creation,dominance in money creation in,dominance in money creation in,EDC,"The chosen label ""dominance in money creation in"" encompasses the concept of dominance or being the dominant source as implied by the original phrases. It maintains the preposition ""in"" which is important for indicating the context or domain where the dominance occurs. Both EDC and CESI proposed this label, and it is the most descriptive and specific among the options, ensuring that the semantic meaning of the original phrases is preserved. The label proposed by CoT, ""Dominant in money creation,"" lacks the preposition ""in"" at the end, which could be necessary for constructing meaningful relationships in a knowledge graph."

941,941,"- rebalance
- rebalancing",rebalancing,Rebalancing,rebalance,rebalancing,CESI,"The term ""rebalancing"" is a gerund that represents the action or process of rebalancing. It has broad semantic coverage as it can refer to the act itself as well as the state of being in the process of rebalancing. This makes it slightly more inclusive than the simple form ""rebalance,"" which is typically used as a verb to instruct or describe the action in a more immediate sense. ""Rebalancing"" can encompass both the ongoing process and the general concept, which makes it a more suitable canonical label for the given phrases. The choice between ""rebalancing"" and ""Rebalancing"" (with a capital 'R') is minor, but since canonical labels are typically not capitalized unless they are proper nouns, ""rebalancing"" in lowercase is the standard convention for such labels. However, since all provided options are capitalized, the choice defaults to ""rebalancing"" with the understanding that in practice, it would likely be used in lowercase."

It captures the essence of both ""had momentum"" and ""had growth momentum,"" as well as the change implied by ""momentum turned."" While ""Undergoing Momentum"" could potentially cover the meaning of the phrases, it is less direct and could introduce ambiguity, as ""undergoing"" might imply a current state rather than a past or changing state.

- strong momentum indicated by",strong momentum indicated by,"""Indicates momentum of""",suggests momentum of,"""Indicates momentum of""",CoT,"The label ""Indicates momentum of"" is the most clear and general of the three options. It captures the essence of all the phrases, which is the indication or evidence of momentum. It is broad enough to encompass both strong and positive momentum, and it avoids the specificity of ""strong momentum"" which may not apply to all cases. Additionally, it uses an active verb ""indicates,"" which is more neutral and widely applicable than ""suggests"" or ""describes,"" making it suitable for a canonical label that represents the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."
946,946,"- not differentiated due to
- cannot differentiate",cannot differentiate,Unable to distinguish due to,not differentiated due to,Unable to distinguish due to,CoT,"The label ""Unable to distinguish due to"" captures the essence of both phrases ""not differentiated due to"" and ""cannot differentiate"" by conveying the inability to differentiate while also implying a reason for this inability with the word ""due."" It is clear, semantically inclusive, and applicable in a variety of contexts where differentiation is not possible because of specific factors."
947,947,"- hard to distinguish from

It also implies a cause for the difficulty, which aligns with the ""because of"" and ""due to"" components in the original phrases. This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to situations where there is a challenge in differentiation."
948,948,"- show pattern in
- indicates pattern",indicates pattern,Demonstrate Pattern,show pattern in,"""indicates pattern""",CESI,"The label ""indicates pattern"" is clear, concise, and has broad semantic coverage that encapsulates the essence of both phrases ""show pattern in"" and ""indicates pattern."" It directly conveys the idea that there is a pattern being pointed out or revealed, which is the core meaning shared by the original phrases. The word ""indicates"" is a more general term than ""show,"" which can imply a broader range of actions leading to the recognition of a pattern, not just visual demonstration. Therefore, it is more inclusive and representative of the various ways a pattern can be presented or identified."
949,949,"- experienced wage growth decline in
- saw wage growth decline in",experienced wage growth decline in,"""Experienced a decline in wage growth""",experienced wage growth decline in,Experienced a decline in wage growth,CoT,"The label ""Experienced a decline in wage growth"" is chosen because it is grammatically complete and provides a clear and concise representation of the semantic meaning shared by the original phrases. It captures the essence of both ""experienced wage growth decline in"" and ""saw wage growth decline in"" by indicating that there was an experience of a decline in wage growth. The use of the article ""a"" and the preposition ""in"" makes the sentence more natural and broadly applicable, allowing for better integration into various contexts within a knowledge graph."

It captures the essence of all the given phrases, which revolve around the concept of something being with something else. The label is clear, semantically inclusive, and can be easily understood in various contexts. It also maintains the original meaning without the specific context of ""onshoring,"" which may not be relevant in all instances. The capitalization of ""Accompanied by"" in CoT's proposal does not add semantic value, so the CESI label is preferable for its simplicity and consistency with standard grammar rules."

It retains the core concept shared by all variations without specifying additional context that may not be applicable to all instances (such as ""time"" in ""record time""). The label is clear and concise, and it is also presented in a neutral format without quotation marks, which are unnecessary for the canonical label. The CESI system's proposal of ""record"" is therefore the best choice."

It is general enough to be applicable to various contexts where liquidity is being discussed, and it directly reflects the action (increase) and the subject (liquidity) without being tied to a specific grammatical construction, making it the most versatile choice for a canonical label. The other options, ""had liquidity increase"" and ""increased liquidity by,"" are more specific and less flexible, and thus do not cover the semantic range as effectively as ""Increase in Liquidity."""
955,955,"- added liquidity amount
- injected liquidity amount

It covers both the addition and removal of liquidity, which is important since the phrases include both injecting (adding) and draining (removing) liquidity. The other two labels, ""added liquidity amount"" and ""injected liquidity amount,"" only cover the addition of liquidity and do not account for the removal aspect, which is represented by the phrase ""drained liquidity from."" Therefore, the CoT label provides the broadest semantic coverage and is the most appropriate for general applicability."

It is general enough to encompass past, present, and future actions, as well as actions that are planned or engineered, without being overly specific. This makes it the most flexible and inclusive option for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."
957,957,"- experience loss due to
- experience demand losses due to pandemic",experience loss due to,"""Experience loss due to""",experience loss due to,"""experience loss due to""",CoT,"The chosen label accurately captures the essence of both phrases, maintaining the core meaning of experiencing a loss due to some external factor. It is clear, broad enough to encompass various types of losses (not just demand-related), and can be generally applied to different scenarios where a loss is experienced due to a specific cause. The label from EDC and CESI is identical and suitable, but the CoT label includes unnecessary quotation marks which do not add to the semantic value and could potentially cause confusion in a knowledge graph context."
958,958,"- spurred by
- spurred confidence
- spurred
- sparked by",spurred by,Stimulated by,spurred by,Stimulated by,CoT,"The term ""stimulated by"" encompasses the idea of being spurred or sparked, which are both indicative of a cause-and-effect relationship where one event or action triggers another. It has broad semantic coverage that can apply to various contexts, whether it be emotional, like ""spurred confidence,"" or causal, like ""spurred by"" or ""sparked by."" It is also clear and understandable, making it a suitable canonical label for the given phrases."

- fueled",fueled by,Powered by,fueled by,"""fueled by""",EDC,"The phrases ""fueled by"" and ""fueled"" are very closely related and essentially convey the same meaning, where one is simply a variant of the other with a preposition. Both EDC and CESI have chosen ""fueled by"" as the canonical label, which directly matches one of the given phrases and implies a cause-and-effect relationship. ""Powered by"" suggested by CoT, while semantically similar, introduces a different verb that could imply a broader range of meanings and might not be as directly interchangeable with ""fueled"" in all contexts. Therefore, ""fueled by"" is the best label as it maintains the original phrasing and accurately represents the semantic intent of both given phrases."
960,960,"- directed to be accommodated for
- has directed to accommodate",directed to be accommodated for,Directed to provide accommodation for,directed to be accommodated for,Directed to provide accommodation for,CoT,"The chosen label ""Directed to provide accommodation for"" captures the essence of both given phrases by indicating an entity is instructed to arrange for lodging or space for someone or something. It uses the active verb ""provide"" which is more broadly applicable and clearer than the passive ""be accommodated for."" Additionally, it avoids the potential ambiguity of ""directed to be accommodated for,"" which could imply that the subject is the one being accommodated rather than the one doing the accommodating. The label from CoT is the most succinct and direct, making it the best choice for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."
961,961,"- purpose in STR calculation
- considering uses for str in",purpose in STR calculation,"""Applying STR in calculations""",purpose in STR calculation,"""purpose in STR calculation""",CESI,"The chosen label ""purpose in STR calculation"" directly reflects the concept of 'purpose' which is common in both original phrases. It is clear, concise, and maintains the original phrasing's intent, which is to denote the reason or objective behind using STR in calculations. While ""Applying STR in calculations"" captures the idea of using STR, it shifts the focus slightly to the act of application rather than the purpose behind it. Therefore, the first label is more accurate in encompassing the semantic meaning of the given phrases."
962,962,"- could curtail
- could be curtailed by",could be curtailed by,Could reduce,could curtail,Could reduce,CoT,"The phrase ""Could reduce"" is a clear and concise representation of the action described by both ""could curtail"" and ""could be curtailed by."" It maintains the core meaning of having the potential to lessen or diminish something, which is the central theme in both original phrases. Additionally, ""Could reduce"" is phrased in an active voice, which generally makes it more broadly applicable and easier to understand in various contexts. It avoids the passive construction found in ""could be curtailed by,"" while still encompassing the meaning of both phrases."
963,963,"- curtailed by
- curtailed",curtailed,Limited by,curtailed by,Limited by,CoT,"The phrase ""Limited by"" captures the essence of both ""curtailed by"" and ""curtailed"" while also being clear and broadly applicable. It conveys the notion of something being restricted or reduced by an external factor, which is the underlying concept of both original phrases. The word ""limited"" is more commonly used and understood than ""curtailed,"" making it more accessible for general applicability. Additionally, the preposition ""by"" indicates the presence of an agent or condition causing the limitation, which is important for the semantic completeness of the relation."
964,964,"- sum of
- is a sum of",sum of,Sum of,sum of,sum of,CoT,"The label ""sum of"" is in lowercase, which is generally preferred for consistency and simplicity in knowledge graphs.

It captures the essence of supporting economic aspects without being too specific about the prepositions ""in"" or ""of,"" which can be interchangeable and context-dependent. Additionally, it includes the notion of ""supported economic activity,"" which implies a broader range of economic support beyond just the ""economy,"" potentially covering various forms of economic contributions and interactions. This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to different contexts where these relations might be used."

It is broad enough to cover all the given phrases, as it implies both the state of the labour force at a point in time and the transitions or variations that may occur. This label is clear, provides a comprehensive semantic range, and is generally applicable to the relations described."
967,967,"- excludes region
- excluded region",excludes region,Region Exclusion,excludes region,excludes region,CESI,"The label ""excludes region"" directly reflects the action described by the original phrases, maintaining the verb-noun structure that indicates the action of exclusion being applied to a region. It is clear, concise, and semantically covers the meaning of both ""excludes region"" and ""excluded region"" without altering the original phrasing significantly. This choice is also consistent with two out of the three systems' suggestions, indicating a consensus on its applicability. ""Region Exclusion"" changes the structure to a noun phrase and may imply a more static concept rather than an action, which could slightly narrow its semantic coverage."
968,968,"- unable to repay
- unable to buy",unable to buy,Inability to perform a financial action,unable to repay,Inability to perform a financial action,CoT,"The label ""Inability to perform a financial action"" is the most inclusive and accurately captures the essence of both phrases ""unable to repay"" and ""unable to buy."" It covers a broader range of financial inabilities, whereas the other two labels are more specific to one of the given phrases. ""EDC: 'unable to repay'"" only represents one aspect of financial inability, and ""CESI: 'unable to buy'"" does not account for the inability to repay. Therefore, ""Inability to perform a financial action"" is the best choice for its clarity, broad semantic coverage, and general applicability to the given phrases."
969,969,"- not necessarily proportional to
- not in proportion to",not in proportion to,Not proportional to,not necessarily proportional to,Not proportional to,CoT,"The chosen label ""Not proportional to"" effectively captures the essence of both phrases, indicating a lack of direct proportionality without the additional qualifiers ""necessarily"" or ""in."" It is clear, concise, and has broad semantic coverage, making it generally applicable to various contexts where the relation might be used. It simplifies the relation to its core meaning, which is that one thing does not change in direct relation to another."
970,970,"- has presence of
- presence of",has presence of,Presence of,has presence of,Presence of,CoT,"The label ""Presence of"" is more concise and still fully captures the meaning of the relation phrases given. It has broad semantic coverage and is applicable in a general context. The word ""has"" in ""has presence of"" is somewhat redundant because the presence of something inherently implies possession or existence within a given context. Therefore, ""Presence of"" is the clearer and more efficient choice."
971,971,"- excluded from
- excluded",excluded from,Exclusion,excluded from,Exclusion,CoT,"The label ""Exclusion"" captures the essence of both ""excluded from"" and ""excluded"" in a clear and general way. It is a noun form that represents the concept of being excluded, which can apply broadly to various contexts where something or someone is being left out or omitted. It is more inclusive and semantically covers both phrases better than the more specific prepositional phrase ""excluded from,"" which may not always be applicable in every context where ""excluded"" might be used."
972,972,"- matched with
- match",matched with,Matched,matched with,matched with,CESI,"The phrase ""matched with"" encompasses the action of matching and implies a relationship between two entities, which is what the original phrases are indicating. It is more descriptive and specific than just ""Matched,"" which could be interpreted in a more passive sense. The preposition ""with"" in ""matched with"" clearly indicates an interaction or connection, which is essential for representing the relation in a knowledge graph context. Therefore, ""matched with"" offers the best clarity and semantic coverage for the given phrases."

974,974,"- excluding
- Excluding",excluding,Excluding,excluding,excluding,CoT,"The label ""excluding"" is more appropriate as it is in lowercase, which is generally more inclusive and flexible for different contexts within a knowledge graph. Canonical labels typically do not start with a capital letter unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. Both EDC and CESI systems propose ""excluding,"" which suggests a consensus on the lowercase form. The capitalization in ""Excluding"" from CoT does not add semantic value and could imply a specific use case or context where capitalization is required, thus limiting its general applicability."
975,975,"- reduction pace determination after
- reduction timing decided",reduction pace determination after,Determining the timing of reduction,reduction pace determination after,Determining the timing of reduction,CoT,"The chosen label ""Determining the timing of reduction"" captures the essence of both phrases provided, which relate to the decision-making process regarding the timing of a reduction. It is clear and broadly covers the semantic meaning of determining when a reduction should occur. The phrase is also general enough to be applicable in various contexts where the timing of a reduction is an important factor. The other two options are less clear and specific to ""pace,"" which may not fully encompass the broader concept of ""timing."""

It is broad enough to encompass both ""edged up"" and ""edged down"" scenarios, as ""down"" can be considered the opposite context of ""up"". The label is clear, concise, and has general applicability to all the given phrases without over-specifying the context (such as ""in"" or ""following"") or the extent (such as ""slightly"" or ""above""). It also avoids the ambiguity of ""Edged up/down in context"", which could be confusing without additional context."

Each phrase implies a point of minimum value or a low point in a context that could be economic, physical, or metaphorical. The label ""Reached its lowest point"" is general enough to apply to various scenarios while being specific enough to convey the essential meaning of experiencing a trough or low point. It also avoids the potential ambiguity of the word ""trough,"" which might not be immediately clear to all audiences. The phrase ""reached trough"" used by CESI and EDC is less clear and could be misinterpreted without the context provided by the word ""lowest."""

It indicates that there is a subject which holds a particular stance and an object towards which the stance is directed. This label maintains the semantic meaning of the original phrases and is broadly applicable to various contexts where such a relationship might be expressed in a knowledge graph. The other options, ""Holds Stance Towards"" and ""stance,"" are either too verbose or too vague, respectively. ""Holds Stance Towards"" adds an unnecessary verb (""Holds"") that does not add clarity, and ""stance"" alone fails to capture the relational aspect of the phrases."
980,980,"- expected higher rate compared to time
- expected higher rate value",expected higher rate value,Expected increase in rate,expected higher rate compared to time,Expected increase in rate,CoT,"The chosen label ""Expected increase in rate"" captures the essence of both phrases by focusing on the key concept of an 'increase in rate' that is 'expected'. It is more general and broadly applicable than the other options, as it does not specify the comparison to time or a value, which may not always be relevant. This label also uses clearer language, making it more understandable and widely applicable across different contexts within a knowledge graph."

This label is more inclusive and general than ""current share,"" which only refers to the present and does not account for the ""previous share"" phrase. Therefore, ""Temporal Ownership Share"" is the best choice as it encompasses both the current and previous states of ownership share, providing broad semantic coverage and general applicability."

Since capitalization can vary depending on the context in which the phrase is used (e.g., at the beginning of a sentence or in a title), the lowercase version ""labelled as"" is more inclusive and broadly applicable. It can be easily adapted to different contexts by changing the first letter to uppercase if necessary, without altering its semantic meaning.

It captures the essence of the relation, which is to describe the subject matter or content of something, without implying the act of verbal expression as ""say about"" does. The term ""Indicate"" suggested by CoT is a bit too broad and does not convey the specific notion of content or subject matter as directly as ""is about"" does.

- in category
- category in",category in,Belongs to category,category of,Belongs to category,CoT,"The phrase ""Belongs to category"" is the most explicit and clear in conveying the idea that an entity is a member or part of a larger category. It encompasses the notion of inclusion and membership that is implied in all three original phrases (""category of,"" ""in category,"" ""category in""). The use of the verb ""belongs"" also indicates possession, which is a common underlying theme in these types of semantic relationships within knowledge graphs. Therefore, ""Belongs to category"" is the most suitable canonical label as it provides a clear and broad semantic understanding of the relationship between an entity and a category it is associated with."

It implies a shortage within a certain area, domain, or resource without limiting the scope to a specific entity that might be in short supply, which could be the case with ""reported shortage of."" The preposition ""in"" generally suggests a broader context, which is suitable for the diverse instances that a knowledge graph might need to represent. Both CoT and CESI suggest this label, indicating a consensus that it is a suitable canonical form for the given phrases."

It is clear and unambiguous, indicating a hierarchical or taxonomic relationship where one entity is a subset or member of another category. The phrase ""belongs to"" suggested by CoT is also a valid representation, but it is slightly broader and less specific to the idea of categorization. Therefore, ""categorized under"" is chosen for its precision and direct mapping to the original phrases."

- classified in",classified as,Classified as,classified as,classified as,CoT,"The label ""classified as"" captures the essence of all the given phrases without any unnecessary capitalization. It is clear and has broad semantic coverage, representing the action of classifying something within a category or class.

991,991,"- facing shortage of
- facing shortages of",facing shortages of,Facing shortage of,facing shortage of,"""facing shortages of""",CESI,"The label ""facing shortages of"" is chosen because it is plural, which covers instances of both single and multiple shortages. Semantically, it is more inclusive and represents the concept that there can be a shortage of one or more items. The plural form is generally more applicable when discussing shortages, as they often involve multiple items or resources. Additionally, the label from CESI is in lowercase, which is more consistent with the typical formatting of labels in knowledge graphs."

- leading to shortages of",leading to shortages of,"""Causing shortage of""",causing shortages of,"""causing shortages of""",EDC,"The label ""causing shortages of"" is chosen because it is grammatically correct and accurately captures the essence of both given phrases. It uses the base form of the verb ""cause,"" which is more general and broadly applicable than the continuous or progressive form ""leading to."" Additionally, it maintains the singular form ""shortage"" which is more commonly used in canonical labels for relations in knowledge graphs and can easily encompass both singular and plural contexts.

It is a more neutral term that can cover a range of scenarios from direct causation to indirect influence. Therefore, it has broad semantic coverage and general applicability, making it suitable to represent all the given relation phrases."
995,995,"- constructed by
- constructed for",constructed by,"""Construction by/for""",constructed by,"""Construction by/for""",CoT,"The label ""Construction by/for"" is the most inclusive and accurately captures the semantic similarity between the phrases ""constructed by"" and ""constructed for,"" as it encompasses both the agent doing the construction and the entity for whom the construction is done.

- inflation data shown in",inflation data shown in,Presenting inflation data,inflation data extend back to,Presenting inflation data,CoT,"The label ""Presenting inflation data"" is more inclusive and broadly covers the semantics of both phrases provided. It encapsulates the idea that inflation data is being conveyed or displayed, which is common to both ""extend back to"" and ""shown in."" The other two labels are more specific and tied to the particular phrasing of the original sentences, which could limit their applicability to other semantically similar phrases.

The label chosen by EDC and CoT is more explicit in indicating the importance of the component within the context of the whole, which is a key aspect of the semantic similarity between the two phrases. The additional quotation marks in the CoT proposal do not add semantic value and could potentially cause confusion in parsing or processing the label, hence the EDC label is preferred for its simplicity and clarity."
1002,1002,"- support analysis of
- support analysis in",support analysis of,Support analysis,support analysis of,Support analysis,CoT,"The label ""Support analysis"" is the most inclusive and general, capturing the essence of both ""support analysis of"" and ""support analysis in"" without being overly specific. It maintains the core meaning while being applicable to a broader range of contexts where the preposition might vary. The other two options are more restrictive due to the inclusion of the preposition ""of,"" which may not be suitable for all instances that the more general ""Support analysis"" could cover."
1003,1003,"- has component
- has components",has component,"""Has Component(s)""",has component,"""has component""",CESI,"The label ""has component"" is clear, concise, and semantically covers both singular and plural forms of the phrase without the need for additional punctuation or characters. It is also in line with the general practice of using the singular form in ontologies and knowledge graphs to represent a category or relation that can apply to multiple instances. Therefore, it is the most generally applicable label for the given relation phrases."
1004,1004,"- includes component
- includes components of",includes components of,"""Comprises components""",includes component,"""includes components of""",CESI,"The label ""includes components of"" seems to capture the essence of the given phrases most accurately. It implies that there are multiple components included, which is consistent with both original phrases. The preposition ""of"" suggests that the components belong to or are part of something larger, which is a common implication in knowledge graphs when expressing part-whole relationships. The label chosen by CESI is more specific than ""Comprises components"" and more inclusive than ""includes component,"" as it explicitly accounts for the plurality of components and their association with a larger entity."

It covers the semantic meaning of all the given phrases without being too verbose or specific to a number, making it broadly applicable to both singular and plural components.

""Do not capture"" is more of a direct command or imperative, which might not fully represent the nuance of ""should not."" Therefore, ""should not capture"" is a more inclusive label that can apply to both phrases given."
1008,1008,"- not captured in
- not captured by",not captured in,"""Not encompassed by""",not captured in,"""Not encompassed by""",CoT,"The label ""Not encompassed by"" provides a broader semantic coverage and general applicability. Both ""not captured in"" and ""not captured by"" suggest that something is excluded or not included within a certain context or domain, which is effectively conveyed by the term ""encompassed."" The word ""encompassed"" implies a comprehensive inclusion, and therefore, ""Not encompassed by"" accurately represents the idea that something is outside the scope or boundaries of what is being referred to. This label also maintains clarity by using common language that is easily understood."
1009,1009,"- does not capture
- not capturing",not capturing,Does not capture,does not capture,not capturing,CESI,"The label ""not capturing"" is in the present continuous tense, which is more general and can be applied to ongoing or habitual actions. It also avoids the contraction ""does not,"" making it slightly more formal and broadly applicable. The capitalization in ""Does not capture"" from CoT is unnecessary for a canonical label, which is typically in lowercase unless it's a proper noun or at the beginning of a sentence. EDC's ""does not capture"" is also a valid representation, but ""not capturing"" is more concise and thus preferable for a canonical label."
1010,1010,"- fails to capture

It is clear, concise, and directly indicates the inability to capture something, which is the common semantic thread among the given phrases. While ""fails to capture"" is also a good candidate, ""Cannot capture"" is slightly more inclusive as it implies a broader range of incapability rather than just failure, which can be seen as a specific type of incapability."
1011,1011,"- strengthening percentage
- strengthening rate",strengthening percentage,Strengthening Proportion,strengthening percentage,Strengthening Proportion,CoT,"The term ""proportion"" is a broader concept that can encompass both the idea of a ""percentage"" and a ""rate,"" as both of these can be considered specific types of proportions.

It is clear and directly conveys the idea that something did not take place, which is the common semantic thread between the given phrases. While ""not observed in"" is specific to observations and could imply a lack of evidence rather than an actual non-event, ""Non-occurrence"" is more broadly applicable to situations where an event did not happen, regardless of observation status. Therefore, it provides a more general and semantically inclusive representation of the relationship."
1013,1013,"- projected path

It is general enough to apply to various contexts where the relation might be used in a knowledge graph. The phrase ""projected path according to"" can be seen as a specific instance of ""projected path,"" where the source or method of projection is specified. Therefore, the more general label without the ""according to"" is preferable for broad applicability. The use of quotation marks in CoT's suggestion is unnecessary for a canonical label and does not add semantic value."

It captures the essence of what it means to have a fallback option and the act of using something as a fallback. This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to various contexts where one might need to refer to a backup or fallback scenario. It is also more descriptive and action-oriented than the more passive ""fallback option for,"" which could imply a static state rather than an action."

It is clear, broadly applicable to various contexts where the cost of funding increases, and semantically covers the essence of the relation phrases given. The label proposed by CoT, ""Increase in Funding Costs,"" is also a good match semantically but uses a slightly different verb (""increase"" instead of ""rise""). However, ""Rise in funding costs"" is a direct match to one of the phrases and is thus chosen for its exactness and simplicity. The EDC label includes ""date,"" which unnecessarily restricts the scope of the relation to instances where a date is involved, which may not always be the case."

The phrase ""could further fuel"" is more specific and suggests an ongoing or additional contribution, whereas ""potential to fuel"" is more general and can encompass both the initial ability to contribute and the ongoing process. The alternative ""Potential to amplify"" suggested by CoT changes the verb to ""amplify,"" which might not always be interchangeable with ""fuel"" in certain contexts, as ""fuel"" often implies providing energy or resources, while ""amplify"" generally means to increase in volume or intensity. Therefore, ""potential to fuel"" is the most representative and broadly applicable label among the three options."

The CoT's suggestion of ""Exhibits behavior across"" changes the plural ""behaviors"" to the singular ""behavior,"" which may slightly narrow the semantic range.

The label by CoT, ""Performing post-analysis,"" introduces an action (""Performing"") that is not explicitly present in the original phrases. The label by CESI, ""includes post analysis,"" is accurate but does not capture the full scope of ""assessment"" that is suggested in the first phrase.

The label from CoT is identical but includes unnecessary quotation marks. Therefore, the label from CESI, ""in May,"" is the best choice."
1091,1091,"- in June
- was in June",was in June,"""Event in June""",in June,"""in June""",EDC,"The label ""in June"" is the most clear and broadly applicable representation of the given phrases. It captures the essential time-related aspect without the additional past tense implied by ""was in June,"" making it more generally applicable to events or situations that occur in June, regardless of tense. The label from CoT, ""Event in June,"" adds an unnecessary noun ""Event,"" which could limit its applicability to only events, whereas ""in June"" can be used for events, states, or other temporal annotations. Therefore, ""in June"" is the best choice for its simplicity and semantic coverage."

- curbed the growth of",curbed the growth of,"""Restricted the growth of""",curbed growth in,"""Restricted the growth of""",CoT,"The label ""Restricted the growth of"" encompasses the meaning of both provided phrases (""curbed growth in"" and ""curbed the growth of"") while also being clear and broadly applicable. It uses the term ""restricted"" which is synonymous with ""curbed"" and maintains the structure that indicates an action affecting the growth of something. This choice is more general and can be applied to a variety of contexts where growth is being limited or controlled, making it semantically comprehensive."

- in April
- in April for
- in April was",in April is,"""in April""",in April is,"""in April""",CoT,"The label ""in April"" is the most general and broadly applicable of the options. It encompasses the notion of something happening within the month of April without specifying the tense or implying an action (as ""is"" or ""was"" might). This makes it more semantically inclusive, as it can apply to past, present, or future events or states without modification. It also avoids the unnecessary specificity of ""in April is"" or ""in April was,"" which limits the applicability to only present or past contexts, respectively. Therefore, ""in April"" is the most suitable canonical label for representing all the given relation phrases."
1094,1094,"- in April fell to
- declined in April from",declined in April from,"""Decreased in April""",in April fell to,"""Decreased in April""",CoT,"The label ""Decreased in April"" is the most clear and broadly applicable of the three options. It captures the essence of a downward movement in a value or quantity during the month of April, which is the common semantic thread between the original phrases. The word ""decreased"" is a more general term than ""declined"" or ""fell,"" making it applicable to a wider range of contexts. Additionally, it avoids the specificity of ""from"" and ""to,"" which are present in the other two options, thus making it more flexible and representative of the given phrases."

This label is clear and encompasses the semantic meaning of both phrases, making it the best choice for representing the group of semantically similar relation phrases."
1099,1099,"- R reviewed by
- R EXPLAINED BY",R reviewed by,R Analyzed by,R reviewed by,R Analyzed by,CoT,"The term ""analyzed"" is broader in scope and encompasses both the act of reviewing and explaining.

It indicates that one thing is showing or mirroring the preference of another, which is a central theme in both original phrases. The word ""reflects"" comes first, which is important as it signifies the action or state being described, followed by ""preference,"" which is the object of the reflection. This order maintains the active relationship between the two concepts, making it semantically clear and general enough to cover various contexts where these phrases might be used."

- fading expected by",expected to fade in,Expected to fade over time,expected to fade in,Expected to fade over time,CoT,"The label ""Expected to fade over time"" captures the essence of both phrases by incorporating the concept of fading and the expectation of it happening over a period of time. This label is more general and semantically inclusive, as it does not specify a particular point in time (""in"" or ""by"") for the fading to occur, thus covering a broader range of similar phrases that may relate to the concept of fading over time. It also maintains clarity and is applicable to a variety of contexts where the fading process is not instantaneous but expected to happen gradually."

The other options, ""called for"" and ""call for,"" are more specific and may not encompass the proactive sense implied by ""calls for"" and ""called for by,"" which suggest an ongoing or active requirement.

It is clear and maintains the core meaning of all the phrases, ensuring semantic coverage without being overly specific."
1107,1107,"- had preference for
- showed preference for",had preference for,Expresses preference for,had preference for,Expresses preference for,CoT,"The label ""Expresses preference for"" is chosen because it encompasses both the past tense ""had preference for"" and the present tense ""showed preference for,"" making it more temporally inclusive and broadly applicable.

1108,1108,"- show preference in
- show preference for",show preference in,Show preference for,show preference in,Show preference for,CoT,"The phrase ""show preference for"" is more commonly used in the English language and has a broader semantic applicability. It implies a choice or liking for something over other options, which encompasses the meaning of ""show preference in"" as well.

It captures the essence of endurance or withstanding something, which is a common theme in all the given phrases. Unlike ""is holding up under"" and ""is holding up due to,"" which suggest specific circumstances (under something or due to something), ""holding up to"" is more versatile and can be used in a variety of contexts, making it the best choice for a canonical label representing the given relation phrases."

The term ""forecasted"" is commonly used in contexts where predictions or expectations are made, such as weather forecasts, and thus can be understood in a wide range of scenarios.

1113,1113,"- dissipate
- dissipate over time",dissipate over time,Dissipate,dissipate,Dissipate,CoT,"The label ""Dissipate"" is broad enough to encompass the concept of ""dissipate over time"" while also being applicable in a more general sense. It captures the essence of the semantic similarity between the given phrases without being overly specific, thus ensuring general applicability. The word ""dissipate"" alone implies a process that occurs over a period of time, making the additional specification of ""over time"" redundant for the canonical label."

- smaller surplus amount in",smaller surplus amount in,"""Smaller surplus according to""",smaller surplus according to,"""smaller surplus according to""",CoT,"The label ""smaller surplus according to"" captures the essence of both phrases well. It indicates a comparison of surplus amounts and specifies that the comparison is based on some external reference or authority, which is implied by the word ""according."" The phrase ""smaller surplus amount in"" is also covered by this label, as it suggests a comparison within a specific context or location, which can be considered a subset of the broader ""according to"" context. The label chosen by EDC is identical to CoT, and since we are not choosing based on order, ""smaller surplus according to"" is the most appropriate label for its clarity and semantic coverage. The CESI label, while specific, seems to limit the context to a location or a specific instance, which might not be as broadly applicable as the chosen label."

It implies protection or mitigation, which is a common theme across all phrases. The preposition ""against"" is more specific than ""to"" or ""in,"" and it indicates the function of opposition or protection, which is relevant in the context of buffering. The inclusion of ""a"" before ""buffer"" follows standard grammatical structure, making it more universally applicable.

It is clear and provides broad semantic coverage by explicitly mentioning both key concepts. It is also generally applicable to all the phrases, whereas the other two options omit one aspect or the other (""estimation year"" omits the effect, and ""effect estimation year"" could imply that the estimation is specifically about the effect, not including broader estimations)."

It is clear and provides a broad semantic coverage that can apply to various contexts where the duration or extension of time is measured in yearly increments.

It is clear and covers the broad semantic range implied by all the given phrases. It is also in the present tense, which makes it generally applicable to current states, and it is appropriately neutral, not implying a past action like ""stopped contributing to"" does. The capitalization in CoT's ""Not contributing to"" is not standard for canonical labels, which typically do not start with a capital letter unless used in a specific context requiring it. Therefore, the CESI label is the most suitable choice."

While ""does not imply"" and ""does not indicate"" are also suitable, they are narrower in scope and may not fully capture the essence of some of the phrases, such as ""does not lead to"" or ""does not disclose.""

Both ""complement"" and ""complements"" are semantically similar and represent the same concept, and the singular form is typically used for canonical labels in knowledge representation. The choice of ""complement"" over ""Complement"" (with a capital ""C"") is due to the convention of using lowercase for such labels unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. Therefore, ""complement"" is the most appropriate label among the options provided."

- help accommodate",Accommodate,Provide Accommodation,Accommodate,Provide Accommodation,CoT,"The phrase ""Provide Accommodation"" encompasses both the action of accommodating and the action of helping to accommodate. It implies an active role in ensuring that accommodation is given, which covers the semantic range of both phrases. ""Accommodate"" on its own is slightly more ambiguous and could refer to a broader set of actions, while ""Provide Accommodation"" specifically denotes the provision of space or resources, aligning well with the context of a knowledge graph where precise relations are important."

It also covers the semantic meaning of both phrases, as it implies that there is a subject which includes countries within its scope. The capitalization in CoT's suggestion is unnecessary and does not enhance the semantic clarity or coverage. EDC's ""countries included"" is in passive voice, which can be less clear because it omits the actor (the entity that includes the countries). Therefore, ""includes countries"" is the most appropriate label."
1248,1248,"- Includes economies
- in economies",Includes economies,Part of economies,Includes economies,Includes economies,EDC,"The phrase ""Includes economies"" directly reflects the semantic meaning of both given phrases, indicating that something encompasses or contains economies within it. ""Part of economies"" (as suggested by CoT) changes the direction of the relationship, implying that the subject is a subset of economies rather than economies being a part of the subject. Therefore, ""Includes economies"" is a clearer and more accurate representation of the given phrases, and it is chosen by both EDC and CESI, which suggests a consensus on its appropriateness."

It captures the essence of an entity being actively applied in a confrontational or adversarial context, which is implied by both original phrases. The label ""Utilized in opposition"" proposed by CoT is also semantically similar but is less direct and more verbose. Therefore, ""used against"" is the most appropriate choice for its simplicity and directness, which enhances general applicability and ease of understanding."

It covers both the aspect of having a target and the action-oriented aspect of aiming for something. While ""has inflation target"" is also a strong candidate, it is slightly less inclusive as it does not explicitly capture the proactive nature of aiming or striving for a target that is present in many of the phrases.

It covers the general case of influence on decisions without specifying the degree or exclusivity of the influence, making it broadly applicable to both phrases. The label is clear and maintains the original phrasing, which ensures that the semantic nuance of ""influence"" is preserved. The alternative ""Influence on decisions"" changes the grammatical structure and could imply a broader range of influences beyond those directly affecting decisions. The addition of ""not influenced solely by"" in one of the phrases suggests a need for a label that can accommodate partial or non-exclusive influences, which ""decisions influenced by"" does effectively."

The phrase ""Changes in"" proposed by CoT is also a strong candidate, but it may imply a broader scope that includes any type of change, not just developments. ""Developments during"" is more temporally bound and might not capture developments that are not tied to a specific time frame. Therefore, ""developments in"" strikes a balance between the two, providing clarity and general applicability."
1263,1263,"- develop
- develops",develop,Develop,develop,develop,CoT,"The label ""develop"" is in lowercase, which is generally preferred for canonical forms as it avoids unnecessary capitalization and is more consistent with common text processing conventions.

It also accurately captures the passive form of the relation, which is applicable regardless of the direction of replacement (whether something replaces or is replaced by something else). The label from EDC and CESI is chosen over CoT's ""Replaced By"" because the use of all lowercase is more conventional for representing relations in knowledge graphs, making it more suitable for general applicability."

The capitalization of both words is not necessary, but it does not detract from its applicability. The word ""target"" can function as both a noun and a verb, making it flexible for various contexts, and the omission of the ""ed"" in ""targeted"" makes the phrase slightly more concise while retaining the full meaning."

The preposition ""with"" in this context is important because it indicates the presence of a replacement. The label ""substituted"" alone could be slightly ambiguous, as it might not always imply the presence of a replacement.

It is a base form that is easily understood and can be used in various semantic contexts. The term ""substitute with"" from CESI introduces a preposition that may not be necessary for all relations, and the capitalization in CoT's ""Substitute"" does not add any semantic value and is inconsistent with standard grammar rules where relation phrases are typically not capitalized unless at the beginning of a sentence."

It encompasses both the action (being dominant) and the context (in or during a certain period or domain). The capitalization in ""Is dominant in"" from CoT is unnecessary as labels typically do not require capitalization unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence.

It is clear and can easily represent the action in present, past, and passive forms without the need for additional modification. This makes it the most generally applicable label for the given phrases.

The label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to various contexts where the state's attributes or descriptions are being referenced. The choice of this label over the others is due to the fact that it is presented without any formatting issues (like the unnecessary quotes in CoT's proposal) and matches the capitalization and punctuation of the original phrases, thus maintaining consistency."

The label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to various contexts where policy measures are discussed. The label from CoT, ""Has policy measures,"" while similar, is not chosen because the capitalization of ""Has"" is inconsistent with standard labeling practices, and the plural form ""measures"" is not necessary to cover the semantic range of the given phrases."

It implies that a policy is formulated and declared by a particular entity, which aligns well with both phrases. The alternative, ""Entity's policy,"" while succinct, could be interpreted as merely possessive, potentially losing the nuance of the entity actively stating or formulating the policy.

The label ""Revision Quantity and Time"" is the only one that captures both the numerical and temporal dimensions present in the original phrases. ""Revision amount"" as proposed by CESI and EDC only captures the numerical aspect and omits the temporal element, which is a significant part of the semantic meaning in at least two of the phrases.

- estimated drop",estimated drop,"""Measured or Estimated Decrease""",amount of drop,"""Measured or Estimated Decrease""",CoT,"The label ""Measured or Estimated Decrease"" encompasses both the notion of measurement and estimation, which are implied in the phrases ""amount of drop"" (which suggests a quantified measurement) and ""estimated drop"" (which directly refers to an estimation). This label is clear and has the broadest semantic coverage, making it generally applicable to various contexts where either a measured or an estimated decrease is being discussed. It captures the essence of both phrases without bias towards one or the other, ensuring a balanced representation."
1300,1300,"- affected countries
- impacted by countries",affected countries,"""Countries affected""",affected countries,"""affected countries""",EDC,"The label ""affected countries"" directly reflects the semantic meaning of both phrases given, maintaining the original word order of the most common phrase structure. It is clear and straightforward, indicating the countries that have been affected. ""impacted by countries"" can be understood as a variation of ""affected countries,"" where ""impacted by"" can be replaced with ""affected."" The label proposed by CoT, ""Countries affected,"" while semantically similar, reverses the word order and may imply a slightly different meaning or emphasis. Therefore, ""affected countries"" is the best choice for its clarity and direct match to the given phrases."
1301,1301,"- has object
- has object of",has object,"""Associated with Object""",has object,"""has object""",EDC,"The label ""has object"" directly reflects the original phrases ""has object"" and ""has object of,"" maintaining the core meaning without adding or subtracting from the semantic content. It is clear, concise, and has broad semantic coverage that accurately represents the relationship indicated by the original phrases. The alternative ""Associated with Object"" introduces a different term ""Associated,"" which may imply a broader or different type of relationship than what is specified by ""has object."" Therefore, ""has object"" is the most appropriate canonical label for general applicability."
1302,1302,"- recorded increases across
- recorded gains during",recorded increases across,Documented positive change in,recorded increases across,Documented positive change in,CoT,"The label ""Documented positive change in"" captures the essence of both ""recorded increases across"" and ""recorded gains during"" while providing a broader semantic coverage. It clearly indicates a positive trend and is applicable to various contexts where there is a record of improvement or growth. The term ""documented"" is synonymous with ""recorded,"" and ""positive change"" encompasses both ""increases"" and ""gains."" This label is also clear and general enough to be widely applicable across different knowledge graph scenarios."
1303,1303,"- expects revision of
- expected revisions can be found in",expected revisions can be found in,"""Anticipates and Locates Revisions""",expects revision of,"""expects revision of""",EDC,"The phrase ""expects revision of"" is clear, concise, and directly captures the essence of the original phrases. It implies anticipation of changes, which aligns with the notion of expecting revisions. The alternative from CESI, ""expected revisions can be found in,"" is more specific to the context where revisions are already present, and it suggests a location where revisions are documented, which may not always be applicable. The CoT label, ""Anticipates and Locates Revisions,"" although it covers both anticipation and location, is less concise and could be seen as overly complex for representing a simple relational concept. Therefore, ""expects revision of"" is the most suitable label for its simplicity and broad semantic coverage."
1304,1304,"- unsuitable due to
- not viable in
- not suitable in",not suitable in,Incompatible due to,unsuitable due to,"""Incompatible due to""",CoT,"The label ""Incompatible due to"" encompasses the idea that something is not only unsuitable but also cannot function or be used in a particular context or situation, which is a broader and more universally applicable concept. It captures the essence of something being not viable or suitable due to specific reasons, which is a common denominator across all the given phrases. This label is clear and maintains the semantic integrity of the original phrases, making it the best choice among the three options."
1305,1305,"- assumes no change in
- assumes no occurrence of",assumes no change in,Assumes no change in,assumes no change in,assumes no change in,CoT,"The chosen label ""assumes no change in"" is in lowercase, which is a common convention for canonical labels in knowledge graphs to ensure consistency and avoid duplicates that differ only in capitalization. This label also captures the core meaning shared by both phrases, which is the assumption that there is no change or occurrence of an event. It is broad enough to cover various contexts where these phrases might be used, making it generally applicable."

- context of sector",context of sector,Sector Context,sector context,Sector Context,CoT,"The label ""Sector Context"" is clear, concise, and captures the essence of the phrases ""sector context"" and ""context of sector."" It uses title case, which is often used for labels and headings, making it stand out as a canonical representation. Moreover, it places ""Sector"" first, which is the primary subject, followed by ""Context,"" which describes the type of information or relation being specified, thus ensuring broad semantic coverage and general applicability."
1307,1307,"- offset pressure on
- offset pressure from",offset pressure on,Offset pressure,offset pressure on,Offset pressure,CoT,"The label ""Offset pressure"" is the most inclusive and general, capturing the essence of both ""offset pressure on"" and ""offset pressure from"" without specifying directionality. This makes it broadly applicable to various contexts where the specific preposition (on/from) might vary but the underlying relationship of offsetting pressure remains constant. Both ""offset pressure on"" and ""offset pressure from"" suggest a direction of the offsetting action, which could limit their applicability in a general sense. By choosing the more concise ""Offset pressure,"" we ensure that the label can be used in a wider range of scenarios while maintaining clarity."
1308,1308,"- reached percentage
- reaches percentage of
- reached rate",reached percentage,"""Reached Level or Percentage""",reached percentage,"""Reached Level or Percentage""",CoT,"This label encompasses both the concept of reaching a specific level and a percentage, which is more inclusive of the different phrases provided. It covers the idea of reaching a rate (which can be interpreted as a level) and a percentage. The use of quotation marks in the label from CoT suggests it is a direct quote or a fixed phrase, which may help in maintaining consistency across different instances where this canonical label might be used. The other two options, ""reached percentage"" and ""reached percentage,"" are limited to percentage only and do not clearly cover the concept of reaching a rate or level."
1309,1309,"- passed by

- pass on",pass on by,Passing by,passed by,Passing by,CoT,"The label ""Passing by"" is in the present continuous tense, which generally denotes an ongoing action and can be considered more inclusive of variations in tense (such as ""passed by"" which is past tense, and ""pass on by"" which can be interpreted as an imperative or a colloquial variation of ""passing by""). This label captures the essence of the action being continuous or repeated, which seems to be the common theme across all given phrases. It is clear, covers the broad semantic meaning of all the phrases, and is applicable in a general context."

It implies a temporal aspect, which is essential in the context of these phrases, and it is clear and concise. The other options either narrow down the scope to a specific point after an event (""effective after"") or abstract it too much (""Effectiveness""), potentially losing the temporal context. ""effective from"" is also case-consistent with the other phrases, whereas ""Effective From"" starts with a capital letter, which is not consistent with the others."
1311,1311,"- was effective following
- effective following",was effective following,"""Became effective after""",was effective following,"""Became effective after""",CoT,"The label ""Became effective after"" captures the essence of both ""was effective following"" and ""effective following"" while providing a clearer and more universally understandable representation of the relationship.

1312,1312,"- actual contraction by
- contraction compared to
- actual contraction compared with",actual contraction compared with,Contraction Comparison,actual contraction by,Contraction Comparison,CoT,"The label ""Contraction Comparison"" is the most inclusive and general term that captures the essence of all three phrases. It encompasses the idea of comparing contractions without specifying the exact preposition (by, compared to, compared with), which makes it broadly applicable to all the given phrases. It is clear and succinct, avoiding the redundancy of ""actual"" and the specificity of the prepositions, which may not be necessary for a canonical label in a knowledge graph."
1313,1313,"- interest rate level lower
- interest rate level present",interest rate level lower,Interest rate level condition,interest rate level lower,Interest rate level condition,CoT,"The label ""Interest rate level condition"" chosen from CoT is the most appropriate as it encompasses both the concept of the interest rate being lower and its current state or condition. It is broad enough to cover various states or changes in the interest rate level, making it semantically inclusive and generally applicable to the given phrases. The other two labels are identical and specific to the ""lower"" condition, which does not capture the ""present"" state implied by the second phrase."

It implies the categorization of something as part of a sector, which is a common theme across all phrases. It is more complete than just ""'sector'"", which is provided by CoT, and it is less specific than ""is a sector with"", which adds an unnecessary preposition that may not always be relevant. The chosen label ""is a sector"" is general enough to be applicable in various contexts while still maintaining the core meaning of the original phrases."

This form can be considered more general and timeless, making it applicable to past, present, and future contexts. It captures the essence of the action without being tied to a specific time, thus offering broad semantic coverage and general applicability. It is also clear and directly reflects the meaning conveyed by all the given phrases."

It is more descriptive and provides a clear understanding that the focus is on the action or process of restraining, rather than on the agent or object alone. This label offers broad semantic coverage and is applicable to various contexts where any form of restraint is involved, making it the most suitable choice among the options provided."

1320,1320,"- has primary responsibility for
- primarily responsible for",primarily responsible for,"""Primarily responsible for""",has primary responsibility for,"""primarily responsible for""",CESI,"The label ""primarily responsible for"" is clear, concise, and captures the essence of the responsibility aspect in both phrases. It is also in the active voice, which is generally more direct and easier to understand in the context of relations. The label from CoT is identical but includes unnecessary quotation marks, while the label from EDC, ""has primary responsibility for,"" is slightly more verbose without adding semantic value. Therefore, the label from CESI is the best choice as it is the most straightforward representation of the given phrases."

It is clear and general enough to apply to various contexts implied by the phrases, such as ""setup of,"" ""set for year,"" ""set at,"" and ""decided to set up."" It also implies a sense of permanence or readiness, which is a semantic component present in most of the phrases. The other candidates, ""set for"" and ""setup of,"" are more specific and less flexible in their applicability, making ""Establish"" the best choice for representing the given relations semantically."

It is clear and encompasses the broad semantic meaning implied by the phrases ""became less negative,"" ""become less negative in,"" and ""less negative due to,"" which all suggest a movement away from negativity. The chosen label is also general enough to apply to various contexts where this transition might occur, making it the most suitable canonical label for representing the given relation phrases."

The other option, ""Demanded,"" lacks this specificity and could be ambiguous, as it does not clearly convey the direction of the demand relationship. The label ""is demanded in"" suggests a context or situation, which is not as universally applicable as ""demanded by."" Therefore, ""demanded by"" is the best choice as it maintains the clarity and broad semantic coverage needed to represent the given relation phrases."

It is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to different contexts where any of the given phrases might be used.

It covers the general case of any percentage of the labour force covered by job retention schemes, which includes the specific case of the highest percentage as well. The label by CESI is too specific as it only refers to the highest percentage, and the CoT label differs only in the spelling of ""labor"" (American English) rather than ""labour"" (British English), which does not affect the semantic coverage but may be relevant for consistency with the provided phrases."
1329,1329,"- dominant driver of

The phrase ""is the dominant driver of"" from CoT includes the verb ""is"" and the definite article ""the,"" which might not be applicable in all syntactic constructions, especially when integrating this label into different sentence structures within a knowledge graph. Therefore, the label ""dominant driver of"" proposed by both EDC and CESI is the most suitable choice as it is clear, semantically inclusive, and has the broadest applicability across different contexts."

- affecting components of",affecting components of,"""Affected Components""",affected components,"""affected components""",EDC,"The phrase ""affected components"" is clear and directly indicates the components that are being impacted, which is the core idea conveyed by both original phrases. It is also in lower case, which is more generally applicable for use in a knowledge graph where labels are typically not capitalized unless they are proper nouns. The phrase ""affecting components of"" suggests a focus on the components causing the effect, which might not fully represent the bidirectional nature of the relationship implied by ""affected components."" The label ""Affected Components"" proposed by CoT is semantically identical to EDC's suggestion, but the use of quotation marks and capitalization is less conventional for canonical labels in knowledge graphs. Therefore, ""affected components"" is the most appropriate choice."

Additionally, by including ""potential,"" it acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in the phrases ""downside risks,"" which is a common theme across all the given phrases.

It maintains the core meaning of a downside risk being notable and having an impact, which is a common thread among the phrases. The use of ""for"" instead of ""to"" provides a more general applicability to different contexts, and the omission of ""considered"" and ""significant"" avoids unnecessary specificity, making it broadly applicable while still conveying the importance of the risk."

Unlike the other two options, which are more specific in their wording and could imply a certain intention or method (""aimed to"" suggests intention, and ""to effectively"" implies a particular degree of success), ""Actively work to prevent or delay"" is more neutral and inclusive of different degrees of effort and success, making it the best representation of the given phrases."

The term ""in"" from the CESI proposal is unnecessary for a canonical label, as it is context-dependent. The EDC label ""contraction percentage"" is less inclusive because it specifically refers to a percentage, which may not always be the unit of measurement.

It retains the core action of ""analyzing"" while being neutral about the perspective or position (i.e., not specifying ""behind""), which makes it more universally applicable to different contexts within a knowledge graph. The alternative ""behind analysing"" is more specific and may not always be relevant, while ""Analyzing"" with a capital 'A' does not add semantic value and is less consistent with standard grammar rules for relation phrases, which typically do not require capitalization unless they are proper nouns."

It is broad enough to cover situations where the outcome is uncertain, which is a common scenario in knowledge graphs, and it maintains the original semantic meaning of the input phrases. ""Will exert pressure on"" changes the verb and adds a level of certainty and force that is not present in the original phrase ""may weigh on.""

""Weighed on"" and ""weighed on by"" are past tense and passive forms, respectively, which could limit their applicability in some contexts. The label ""weighs on"" is also the choice of one of the systems (EDC), indicating that it is already in use and likely to be understood in the context of a knowledge graph.

It captures the essence of the action without the additional ""is"" which is present in one of the variants but not necessary for the canonical form. The label ""To preserve"" with a capital ""T"" is less conventional because labels are typically presented in lowercase for consistency and to avoid case sensitivity issues in processing.

Both phrases indicate an action aimed at maintaining or protecting something. The label ""help to preserve"" is more grammatically complete and is likely to be understood as encompassing both variations of the phrase. The alternative label ""Help in preservation"" suggested by CoT changes the structure to a noun form (""preservation"") which, while related, does not exactly match the verb form (""preserve"") found in the original phrases. Therefore, ""help to preserve"" is the best label as it directly reflects the verb form used in the original phrases and maintains the action-oriented meaning."

The phrase is also commonly used and understood in various contexts, making it a suitable canonical label. The choice of CESI's label is due to its use of quotation marks for clarity and the lower case which is more standard for canonical labels, as opposed to the EDC's choice which lacks quotation marks and CoT's choice which uses an initial capital letter that is not necessary and might imply it is a proper noun or the start of a sentence."

It captures the core action described by all the phrases without the additional specificity of ""to"" or ""quality,"" which may not be relevant in all contexts where the relation might be used. The label is also in the present tense, which is typically preferred for canonical forms in knowledge graphs as it allows for generalization across different instances. The choice of EDC's label over CoT's is due to the unnecessary quotation marks in CoT's suggestion, which do not add clarity or value."
1506,1506,"- passed on to
- partially passed on to",partially passed on to,Transferred to,passed on to,Transferred to,CoT,"The label ""Transferred to"" is the most inclusive and broadly applicable term that can encompass both ""passed on to"" and ""partially passed on to.""

Both original phrases imply that flexibility is not constant and can differ when considering different entities or contexts. The label ""flexibility varies among"" is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to situations where flexibility is being compared or contrasted across multiple entities or groups. The alternative label ""Flexibility varies depending on the context"" introduces a new element (""depending on the context"") which is not present in the original phrases and thus may not capture all possible uses of the relation."

It also has general applicability to various contexts where the pace of one entity is being compared with another. The label proposed by CoT, ""'Comparing pace'"", while succinct, uses quotation marks which are unnecessary and could imply a direct quote rather than a canonical label. Additionally, ""Comparing pace"" could be interpreted as a more general activity rather than a specific relation between two entities. Therefore, ""pace compared with"" is the most appropriate label for representing the given relation phrases."

It encompasses both the notion of a future or estimated state (as implied by ""projected"" and ""estimated"") and the applicability to a particular subject or context (as indicated by ""for""). The preposition ""for"" is more inclusive and can be used in a broader range of contexts than ""in,"" which might imply a more specific location or time.

1521,1521,"- risks mitigated by
- mitigate risk of",risks mitigated by,"""Mitigating risk""",risks mitigated by,"""risks mitigated by""",EDC,"The label ""risks mitigated by"" directly reflects the action and the directionality of the relationship, indicating what is being mitigated (risks) and who or what is performing the mitigation (implied by ""by""). It covers both given phrases semantically, as both phrases imply an action of mitigation being performed on risks. The label ""Mitigating risk"" proposed by CoT, while clear, does not explicitly capture the directionality of the relationship, which is important in a knowledge graph to understand which entity is mitigating the risk and which entity is being protected. Therefore, ""risits mitigated by"" is the most precise and applicable label."

""Obligation to Mitigate"" is too strong as it does not accurately represent the less forceful ""may mitigate"" and ""should mitigate"" phrases. ""should mitigate"" implies a recommendation but does not cover the possibility or requirement aspects as effectively as ""may mitigate.""

It captures the core meaning shared by both phrases, which is the translation of some event or action into a decrease in GDP. The words ""by"" and ""without"" in the original phrases specify additional conditions, but they are not essential to the core meaning that is being conveyed, which is that something is causing GDP to decrease.

- has more investment in",has more investment in,"""Has greater investment than""",has higher investment than,"""Has greater investment than""",CoT,"The label ""Has greater investment than"" encompasses the notion of comparison in terms of investment magnitude, which is common to both original phrases. It implies a comparison of investment levels without being restricted to a specific form of investment (i.e., it could be monetary, time, resources, etc.), thus offering broad semantic coverage. Additionally, the use of ""greater"" rather than ""higher"" or ""more"" allows for a more general applicability across different contexts where the type of investment may vary. The capitalization of the first word is a minor stylistic difference and does not affect the semantic clarity of the label."

The term ""increasing"" in the first option (CoT) suggests an ongoing action, which might not always accurately represent a state or a completed action implied by the past tense ""increased."" The second option (CESI) is in plural form, which might not be as inclusive for cases where the singular form is more appropriate.

While ""buying"" is a gerund and can be seen as a more casual or colloquial term, ""purchase"" is universally understood and can be used in both formal and informal contexts, making it a better canonical label for semantic coverage and general applicability. Additionally, ""purchase"" is in the base form, which is typically preferred for canonical labels in knowledge graphs for consistency and ease of mapping.

It is clear and can be generally applied to various contexts where a marginal contribution is made, not limited to growth alone. The label is also in lowercase, which is a common practice for canonical labels in knowledge graphs to maintain consistency and avoid case-sensitivity issues.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""plans"" rather than ""plan"" suggests an ongoing or future action, which is relevant to the concept of reinvestment.

The word ""commits"" is more definitive than ""plans"" or ""intends,"" and therefore it captures the strongest level of intent present across all the phrases.

This label also uses proper grammatical structure, which improves readability and understanding. The other two options, ""made decision on"" and ""made decision on"" (both from CESI and EDC), are less clear because they omit the article ""a"" before ""decision,"" which can make the phrase sound incomplete or less natural in some contexts.

The label ""Decided"" (from CoT) is also a good candidate but lacks the preposition that might be necessary for certain contexts. ""decided at"" suggests a location or time which is not necessarily implied in the other phrases, so the preposition ""on"" in ""decided on"" is more representative of the general act of deciding.

The word ""contributes"" is more inclusive and general, covering different ways in which something can account for or make up the import percentage. It also avoids the redundancy of the word ""percentage"" being associated with ""makes up,"" which could imply a tautology since ""makes up"" already suggests a part of a whole, which is what a percentage represents.

The phrase ""operations conducted during"" could imply a time aspect, but in the context of a knowledge graph, it is likely referring to operations conducted at a specific event or within a specific operation timeframe, which can still be encompassed by the notion of ""at"" as it can refer to events or contexts as locations in a broader sense. The label ""Operations conducted in"" suggested by CoT is also semantically similar, but the use of plural and the preposition ""in"" might slightly narrow the scope to imply an enclosed space or a larger context, which may not be as universally applicable as ""at"".

- indicative need for",indicated need for,Indicates need for,indicated need for,Indicates need for,CoT,"The label ""Indicates need for"" captures the essence of both phrases while using the present tense, which generally has broader semantic coverage and applicability in knowledge representation. It is clear and succinct, and it normalizes the relation to a more general form, making it suitable for a canonical label that can represent similar phrases."
1657,1657,"- reason for weak growth
- reason for subdued growth",reason for subdued growth,"""Cause for weak/subdued economic growth""",reason for weak growth,"""Cause for weak/subdued economic growth""",CoT,"This label chosen from the CoT system encompasses both ""weak"" and ""subdued,"" which are semantically similar and reflect the variations in the original phrases. Additionally, it adds the word ""economic,"" which provides context to the type of growth being discussed, making it more informative and applicable to a broader range of scenarios within a knowledge graph. The use of ""cause"" instead of ""reason"" is also a good choice as it is a more encompassing term that can cover a wider array of factors leading to the weak or subdued growth."
1658,1658,"- consolidated
- consolidates",consolidated,Consolidate,consolidated,Consolidate,CoT,"The label ""Consolidate"" is the base form (infinitive) of the verb and thus represents the action in a general, timeless manner. It covers both the past tense ""consolidated"" and the present tense ""consolidates,"" making it the most broadly applicable label for the relation phrases. It is clear and encompasses the full semantic range of the action without being restricted to a specific tense."
1659,1659,"- discontinue
- discontinue at
- discontinuation starts
- discontinue as of",discontinue,Discontinuation,discontinue,Discontinuation,CoT,"The label ""Discontinuation"" captures the essence of all the given phrases as it represents the action or process of discontinuing something, which is the common theme across all phrases. It is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to various contexts where the action of ending or stopping something is described. It also encompasses the idea of a point in time when something ceases, which is implied in phrases like ""discontinue at"" and ""discontinue as of."" The nominal form ""Discontinuation"" is more inclusive and representative of the concept as a whole, compared to the verb ""discontinue,"" which could imply an imperative or an action in progress."
1660,1660,"- projected weak growth due to
- slower growth projection due to",slower growth projection due to,"""Anticipated slow growth caused by""",projected weak growth due to,"""Anticipated slow growth caused by""",CoT,"The label ""Anticipated slow growth caused by"" chosen from CoT system encompasses the meaning of both phrases by using ""anticipated"" as a synonym for ""projected"" and ""projection,"" while ""slow growth"" is a more general term that covers both ""weak growth"" and ""slower growth."" Additionally, ""caused by"" is a clear and direct way to indicate the causal relationship, which is semantically equivalent to ""due to."" This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to the given phrases."
1661,1661,"- slow growth due to
- cause slower growth in
- slower growth in",slower growth in,"""causes slower growth""",slow growth due to,"""causes slower growth""",CoT,"The label ""causes slower growth"" effectively captures the essence of all three phrases by indicating a causal relationship that results in slower growth. It is clear and directly states the cause-effect nature of the relationship, which is implied in all the original phrases. Additionally, it is general enough to be applicable in various contexts where the growth of an entity is being affected. The other options either lack the explicit mention of causality (""slower growth in"") or are less concise and potentially more context-specific (""slow growth due to"")."

- related to activities of",activity of,"""Activity Related""",activity,"""activity""",EDC,"The label ""activity"" is the most general and broadly applicable term among the options. It captures the essence of all the given phrases without being too specific or restrictive. The other options, ""activity of"" and ""Activity Related,"" imply a specific direction or context that may not be applicable in all cases where the general term ""activity"" could be used. Therefore, ""activity"" offers the clearest and most inclusive representation of the various phrases."
1663,1663,"- has maximum total amount
- has maximum value",has maximum total amount,"""Has the highest value""",has maximum total amount,"""Has the highest value""",CoT,"The label ""Has the highest value"" encompasses the concept of both having the ""maximum total amount"" and ""maximum value,"" as both phrases imply a comparison of magnitude and suggest that the subject possesses the greatest quantity or worth among comparable entities. The word ""highest"" is a common term used to denote the topmost or utmost in a range, which can apply to both numerical amounts and abstract values, providing broad semantic coverage. Additionally, the use of ""value"" is versatile and can be interpreted in various contexts, including financial, numerical, and qualitative scenarios, making it generally applicable. The label also benefits from being in title case (""Has the highest value""), which is a common convention for canonical labels in knowledge graphs, enhancing its clarity and formal appearance."

This label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to the given phrases. It captures the essence of ""service provision,"" ""provision to,"" and ""provision of,"" while also being inclusive of the context implied by ""regarding provision of."" The addition of ""Service"" helps to clarify the kind of provision being referred to, making it a more informative label than the other options."
1665,1665,"- given
- given to",given to,Providing,given,given to,CESI,"The phrase ""given to"" encompasses the action of providing or transferring something from one entity to another, which is implied in both ""given"" and ""given to."" It is more specific and descriptive than just ""given,"" and while ""Providing"" is a good synonym, it is slightly less direct than the phrase ""given to,"" which is already present in the original phrases. Therefore, ""given to"" maintains the clarity and specificity needed to represent the relation accurately in a knowledge graph."
1666,1666,"- mandated
- mandated by",mandated by,Required by,mandated,mandated by,CESI,"The phrase ""mandated by"" captures the essence of both given phrases, as it implies that there is an entity which is imposing a mandate. The preposition ""by"" indicates the direction of the mandate, specifying who is responsible for the mandate. This is more informative and semantically rich than the standalone ""mandated,"" which does not by itself indicate the source of the mandate. ""Required by"" could be seen as a synonym, but it is slightly less specific than ""mandated by,"" as ""required"" can imply a broader range of necessities beyond formal or authoritative mandates. Therefore, ""mandated by"" is the most precise and applicable label for the given phrases."
1667,1667,"- mandate
- has mandate",has mandate,Authority to Carry Out a Task,mandate,has mandate,CESI,"The phrase ""has mandate"" clearly indicates a relationship where one entity is granted the authority to perform a task by another. It is more explicit than ""mandate"" alone, which could be interpreted as a noun rather than a relational phrase. ""Authority to Carry Out a Task"" is descriptive but overly verbose and not as straightforward for a canonical label in a knowledge graph context. ""Has mandate"" strikes a balance between clarity and semantic coverage, making it suitable for general applicability."
1668,1668,"- at cost of
- at expense of
- comes at the expense of",at expense of,"""At the expense of""",at cost of,"""at expense of""",CESI,"The phrase ""at expense of"" captures the essence of the given relation phrases without being overly specific or tied to a particular context. It is clear and concise, and it retains the broad semantic meaning that encompasses the notion of something being sacrificed or incurred as a cost for something else. The phrase ""at cost of"" could imply a more financial or transactional connotation, while ""comes at the expense of"" is more verbose and specific to situations where a consequence is directly following an action. ""At expense of"" strikes a balance between these variations and is generally applicable across different contexts where one thing negatively impacts another."
1669,1669,"- average contribution to
- has average contribution",average contribution to,"""provides an average contribution to""",average contribution to,"""average contribution to""",CESI,"The label ""average contribution to"" is concise, clear, and directly captures the essence of the given phrases without adding unnecessary words. Both ""average contribution to"" and ""has average contribution"" imply a subject making an average contribution towards something, and the chosen label encompasses this relationship without the additional verb ""provides"" which is present in the CoT proposal. The CESI and EDC proposals are identical, and they both represent the relation phrases with simplicity and broad applicability, making ""average contribution to"" the best choice."

It captures the essence of all the phrases, which is the reduction in the quantity of exports, without specifying the manner (e.g., ""drop,"" ""fall,"" ""decline"") or the specific metrics (e.g., ""by,"" ""to""). It is broad enough to encompass all variations of the decrease in exports, making it the most suitable canonical label for representing the given relation phrases semantically."
1671,1671,"- fueling expectations of
- fueled expectations of",fueled expectations of,Fueling expectations of,fueling expectations of,"""fueling expectations of""",EDC,"The label ""fueling expectations of"" is in the present continuous tense, which generally implies an ongoing action or state. This form is more inclusive and can represent both past and present situations, as the past tense ""fueled expectations of"" can be considered a specific instance of the broader ongoing action ""fueling expectations of."" Additionally, the choice of lowercase letters makes it more consistent with typical conventions in knowledge graphs where relation phrases are not usually capitalized unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. The CoT label ""Fueling expectations of"" starts with a capital letter, which might not be as broadly applicable in all contexts. Therefore, the EDC label is the most suitable choice for representing the given relation phrases."
1672,1672,"- products available less than
- less available than",less available than,Lesser availability of products,products available less than,Lesser availability of products,CoT,"The label ""Lesser availability of products"" captures the essence of both phrases by indicating a comparative degree of availability, which is the core idea behind ""products available less than"" and ""less available than."" It is clear, broad in semantic coverage, and can be generally applied to various contexts where the availability of products is being compared. The other two options are more specific and less inclusive of the general idea of comparative availability."

It is clear and directly references the concept of an ""average expectation difference,"" which is common to both original phrases. The label from CoT, while descriptive, adds the term ""compared to a standard,"" which is not present in the second phrase and may not be applicable in all contexts where the relation is used. Therefore, the label ""has average expectation difference of"" is preferred for its clarity and direct semantic alignment with the given phrases."
1674,1674,"- lost between

- fall between",fell between,"""In between""",lost between,"""In between""",CoT,"The phrase ""In between"" is the most general and neutral term that can encompass both the concept of something being lost or falling between two points, entities, or concepts. It does not imply a direction or action like ""fell between"" or ""lost between,"" which are more specific and suggest a particular scenario. ""In between"" is broad enough to cover the semantic range of the given phrases while maintaining clarity and general applicability."
1675,1675,"- before time
- after time",before time,"""Temporal Relation""",before time,"""Temporal Relation""",CoT,"The label ""Temporal Relation"" is the most inclusive and broadly applicable term that encompasses both ""before time"" and ""after time."" It clearly indicates that the relations are concerned with time, without specifying a particular direction, which makes it semantically representative of both phrases. The labels ""before time"" from EDC and CESI are more specific and do not cover the ""after time"" relation, thus limiting their semantic coverage."
1676,1676,"- start to tumble at
- tumble due to",tumble due to,"""Cause to tumble""",start to tumble at,"""tumble due to""",CESI,"The phrase ""tumble due to"" captures the causative nature of the relationship between the subject and the event of tumbling, which is implied in both original phrases ""start to tumble at"" and ""tumble due to.""

1678,1678,"- major risk factors include
- risk factors include",risk factors include,Indicating risk factors,major risk factors include,risk factors include,CESI,"The chosen label ""risk factors include"" is the most representative and inclusive of the given phrases. It maintains the core meaning of both phrases by indicating the inclusion of certain factors that contribute to risk. The label is clear, semantically broad enough to encompass both ""major risk factors include"" and ""risk factors include,"" and is generally applicable to various contexts where risk factors are discussed. The word ""major"" in the third option is more restrictive and may not apply to all instances of the relation, while the first option ""Indicating risk factors"" is less direct and could imply a broader range of relations than just inclusion."
1679,1679,"- risk factor

It is more specific than just ""risk factor,"" which could be interpreted as a standalone concept without an implied link to a particular condition. ""Risk factor of"" suggests possession, which is less commonly used in the context of risk factors and their associated conditions. Therefore, ""risk factor for"" provides the clearest and most broadly applicable representation of the relationship between a risk factor and its outcome, making it the best choice among the three options."
1680,1680,"- has macro impact

- implication of",implication in,Implication of,implication for,Implication of,CoT,"The phrase ""Implication of"" is the most broadly applicable and semantically clear option to represent the given group of relation phrases. It covers the notion of consequence or significance that something (a subject) has for another thing (an object), which is a common thread among all the phrases. Additionally, ""of"" is a preposition that generally indicates belonging or a relationship between two entities, which is central to the concept of implication in a knowledge graph context. Therefore, it can effectively encompass the meanings of ""implication for,"" ""implication in,"" and ""R implication in"" while maintaining clarity and general applicability."

The label ""has advantage"" is clear, directly reflects the positive aspect implied by most of the phrases, and is semantically broad enough to encompass the notion of offering or providing advantages. While ""Benefit"" is a good candidate, it is a noun and does not capture the relational aspect as directly as ""has advantage."" On the other hand, ""has disadvantage"" is not representative of the majority of the phrases, as it indicates a negative aspect, which is the opposite of what the other phrases imply. Therefore, ""has advantage"" is the most appropriate label to represent the given relation phrases."
1685,1685,"- level last observed in
- observed level in",level last observed in,"""Level observed at a specific time""",level last observed in,"""Level observed at a specific time""",CoT,"This label encompasses both the immediacy implied by ""level last observed in"" and the general observation indicated by ""observed level in."" It captures the essence of a level being measured or noted at a particular point in time, which is common to both phrases. The other two candidate labels, while accurate, are more specific and do not cover the general case as well as the chosen label does.

It is clear, semantically broad, and can be generally applied to various contexts where an entity announces a planned discontinuation. The capitalization in the CoT label does not add any semantic value and is not a standard practice for representing relationships in knowledge graphs, which typically do not differentiate based on capitalization. Therefore, the EDC and CESI labels, which are identical, are more appropriate, and I have chosen one of them as the best label."
1687,1687,"- is followed by
- followed by",followed by,Follows,is followed by,followed by,CESI,"The label ""followed by"" is clear, concise, and directly represents the action described by the original phrases. It covers the semantic meaning of both ""is followed by"" and ""followed by"" without the additional verb ""is,"" which is implied.

It directly reflects the core action described by all the phrases, which is the act of naming. It is clear and concise, and it covers the semantic meaning of all the given phrases without adding any additional context or specificity that might not apply in all cases. The other options, ""Assigning a Name"" and ""named as,"" introduce nuances that are not necessarily present in all the original phrases. ""Assigning a Name"" suggests an active process, which might not be suitable for passive descriptions, and ""named as"" implies a formal declaration, which again might not be universally applicable. Therefore, ""named"" is the most appropriate canonical label."
1689,1689,"- featured in
- appeared in

It implies that an entity has a significant presence within something, which is a common thread among the phrases ""featured in,"" ""appeared in,"" and ""to feature in."" Additionally, ""featured in"" is already commonly used in knowledge graphs and databases to denote the relationship where an entity is part of a larger work or event, making it a familiar and clear choice for representing these relations. The label ""Made an appearance in"" proposed by CoT is slightly less precise as it could imply a more transient or less significant presence than ""featured in."" Therefore, ""featured in"" is the best choice for its clarity and broad semantic coverage."
1690,1690,"- respond by postponing

- postponing",postponing,Postpone,respond by postponing,Postpone,CoT,"The label ""Postpone"" is the most clear and broadly applicable term that encompasses the essence of all the given phrases. It is a simple, direct verb that effectively represents the action described by all the variations of the phrase. ""Respond by postponing"" is more specific and includes an additional action (responding), which is not necessarily implied in the other phrases. ""Postponing"" is a gerund and thus less direct than the simple verb form. Therefore, ""Postpone"" is the best choice for a canonical label as it is concise and captures the general action described by all the phrases."
1691,1691,"- Follows
- follows",Follows,Follows,Follows,Follows,CESI,"The relation phrases given are ""Follows"" and ""follows,"" which only differ in capitalization. The canonical label should represent the same action or relationship in a clear and general way. The label ""Follows"" with an initial capital letter is appropriate as it is standard to use initial capitals for labels in knowledge graphs to denote relationships or properties. This choice does not alter the semantic meaning of the phrases and maintains clarity and broad semantic coverage. All three systems proposed the same label, which indicates a consensus on the standard representation of this relation."
1692,1692,"- Follow

All three systems propose the same label with the first letter capitalized. Capitalizing the first letter is a common convention for labels in knowledge graphs, as it provides a clear and proper format, especially when used as a relation in sentences or graph representations. Therefore, any of the proposed labels would be equally suitable. However, since I need to choose one, I will go with the label ""Follow"" as it is consistent with the standard conventions of English grammar for titles and labels, ensuring clarity and general applicability."

1694,1694,"- ensures stability in
- ensures stabilization of",ensures stabilization of,Ensures stability of,ensures stability in,ensures stability of,CoT,"The phrase ""ensures stability of"" combines the key elements from both original phrases. It captures the notion of ""ensuring"" and ""stability,"" which are present in both, and uses ""of"" to indicate the relationship to the object, which is more broadly applicable than ""in"" because it can refer to both physical and abstract forms of stability. The capitalization in ""Ensures stability of"" from CoT is not necessary as labels are typically presented in lowercase in knowledge graphs for consistency.

It is more general and covers scenarios where the duration of something is increased or there is an increase after a certain duration. The other two options are more specific and might not fully represent the semantic similarity of the given phrases, as they imply a sequence (something increases after a duration) rather than the effect on the duration itself."

The phrases ""postponed in,"" ""have postponed,"" and ""can be postponed"" all imply that an event or action has been delayed, which is directly captured by the term ""postponed."" The other options, ""Has been postponed"" and ""postponed in,"" either add unnecessary verb tenses or prepositions that may not be applicable in all contexts. Therefore, ""postponed"" is the most generally applicable label."
1699,1699,"- before publishing

It is also in lowercase, which is generally preferred for consistency and ease of use in knowledge graphs and databases. Both EDC and CESI proposed this label, but since we are not choosing based on order, ""plunged"" is the appropriate choice regardless of which system suggested it. The CoT label ""Plunged"" is semantically identical but uses an initial capital, which is unnecessary unless it is a proper noun or at the beginning of a sentence."

It is clear and broadly applicable to various contexts where the other phrases might be used. Capitalization is not necessary for canonical labels in a knowledge graph, so ""Control"" from CoT is not preferred. ""Control for"" from CESI is more specific and may not cover instances where the simpler ""control"" is used alone. Therefore, ""control"" from EDC is the best choice."

It suggests an entity is performing the action of control over another entity, which is semantically consistent with both original phrases. This label also has broad semantic coverage and is generally applicable to various contexts where control is a factor, making it the most suitable canonical label among the options provided."

It is clear, concise, and semantically covers the intent of both ""Needs Preparation"" and ""need to prepare"" without altering the original verb form, which helps in preserving the meaning across different instances. ""Requires Preparation"" is also a valid canonical label, but it introduces a different verb (""requires"") that, while synonymous, is not present in the original phrases.

The label chosen by both CESI and EDC reflects this approach. The CoT proposal starts with an uppercase ""Use,"" which might imply a proper noun or the start of a sentence, which is less suitable for a canonical label in a knowledge graph where labels are typically expected to be in lowercase for uniformity."

It is typically capitalized only at the beginning of sentences, so the capitalization in ""And"" is not standard and does not affect its semantic meaning. The label ""and"" is semantically identical, but the lowercase form is more common and therefore might be more broadly applicable as a canonical label. The label ""or"" represents an alternative or choice between options and does not have the same meaning as ""and"".

It is broad enough to encompass both scenarios where concentration decreases either by comparison to another entity or due to a specific cause. The label is clear in its description of the relationship and is generally applicable to situations where one entity's concentration is reduced relative to another or due to an external factor."
1812,1812,"- continue applying
- continue to apply
- plans to continue applying",continue to apply,Continue to apply,continue applying,continue to apply,CoT,"The phrase ""continue to apply"" captures the essence of an ongoing or future action, which is a common thread among the given phrases. It is clear and maintains the infinitive form ""to apply,"" which is present in two of the three original phrases, suggesting it is a more representative choice. The CESI's choice of lowercase is preferred for consistency with general language usage in knowledge graphs, where relation phrases are typically not capitalized unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence."
1813,1813,"- status change in
- change status",status change in,Change Status,status change in,Change Status,CoT,"The label ""Change Status"" is concise, clear, and directly captures the essence of the action described by the phrases. It uses the imperative form, which is often preferred for canonical labels as it suggests the action to be taken or the relationship's nature. ""status change in"" is more passive and context-dependent, which might not be as universally applicable. ""Change Status"" is also grammatically correct and maintains the semantic meaning of the original phrases while being more succinct."

It is broad enough to encompass situations where something is currently problematic or has the potential to be problematic in the future. This label also maintains a clear and general applicability across various contexts, which is essential for a canonical label in a knowledge graph. It avoids the specificity of ""because"" or ""due to,"" which may not always apply, and it includes both current and potential issues, which may be missed by the phrase ""potentially problematic due to."""
1815,1815,"- decreased from spike
- declined since spike before",decreased from spike,Decreased after spike,decreased from spike,Decreased after spike,CoT,"The label ""Decreased after spike"" captures the essence of both phrases by indicating a clear temporal sequence where a spike occurs first, followed by a decrease. It is more inclusive as it implies a decrease that happens subsequent to a spike without specifying the origin of the decrease, which makes it applicable to a broader range of scenarios. The other two options, ""decreased from spike"" and ""declined since spike before,"" are more specific and might not cover cases where the decrease is not directly from the spike itself or where the spike is not immediately before the decrease."
1816,1816,"- limits negative impact of
- limits impact on",limits negative impact of,"""Limits negative impact of""",limits negative impact of,"""limits negative impact of""",CoT,"The chosen label ""limits negative impact of"" is the most inclusive and semantically representative of the given relation phrases. It captures the essence of both ""limits negative impact of"" and ""limits impact on"" by focusing on the aspect of limitation and the negative impact.

- initial rate",initial rate,"""Initial Measure""",initial percentage,"""initial rate""",CESI,"The term ""initial rate"" is broad enough to encompass both the concept of a percentage and a rate, as both can be measures of a quantity at the outset of a process or time period. ""Initial percentage"" might be too specific, as not all initial rates are necessarily expressed as percentages. ""Initial Measure"" is also a good candidate as it is quite broad, but it may be too vague and less immediately clear that it refers to a rate or percentage. ""Initial rate"" strikes a balance between specificity and generality, making it the most suitable label for representing all the given relation phrases."
1821,1821,"- initial value in
- initial value",initial value in,"""Initial Value""",initial value in,"""initial value in""",CESI,"The chosen label ""initial value in"" covers both phrases given, as it includes the preposition ""in"" which may be necessary for certain contexts where the initial value is associated with a specific domain or entity. The label without ""in"" might be too broad and miss the context where the initial value is tied to something specific, while the label with quotes is not necessary and does not add semantic value. Therefore, ""initial value in"" is the most representative and semantically inclusive choice."

It is clear and easily understandable, and it broadly covers the semantic meaning of both phrases, as it does not imply a directionality (i.e., whether the amount is as of that date or must be reached by that date). It is also formatted with title case, which is often used for labels and headings, making it appear more standardized for use as a canonical label in a knowledge graph."

It includes the verb ""has,"" which implies possession or association, and this is a common structure for expressing relationships in knowledge graphs. It covers the semantic meaning of all the phrases by indicating that there is a stance that is being projected by a subject. The other options either lack the verb, making them less explicit (""projected stance""), or include unnecessary punctuation (""'Has projected stance'""), which does not add to the clarity or semantic coverage."

Therefore, this label provides clarity and semantic coverage for the given phrases."
1827,1827,"- perceived by
- perceived as",perceived by,Perception,perceived by,Perception,CoT,"The label ""Perception"" is the most inclusive and general term that encompasses both ""perceived by"" and ""perceived as."" It captures the essence of the act or state of perceiving and can be applied to various contexts where something is being perceived, regardless of who or what is doing the perceiving or how something is being perceived.

It is clear and has broad semantic coverage, as it can be applied to various contexts where factors are being weighed or accounted for. Both ""factor in"" and ""factor into"" imply inclusion in a broader context, and ""must factor in"" indicates a necessity to include, which is also encompassed by the chosen label as it implies significance and therefore necessity."
1831,1831,"- perception
- perception of",perception of,Sensory Perception,perception,perception,EDC,"The label ""perception"" is the most inclusive and broadly applicable term that encompasses both given phrases without adding additional context that may not be applicable in all cases. ""Sensory Perception"" is more specific and may not cover all types of perception, while ""perception of"" is a prepositional phrase that may imply a need for an object of perception, which is not always necessary.

It is clear and concise, removing any unnecessary prepositions (""by"") that do not contribute to the core meaning. Additionally, it is in a noun phrase form, which is generally more adaptable for representing relationships in knowledge graphs where the directionality of the increase can be implied by the structure of the graph itself. This label maintains broad semantic coverage and can be easily understood and applied in various contexts where the relationship needs to be identified."
1834,1834,"- increase in participation since
- participation increase in",increase in participation since,Increase in participation over time,increase in participation since,Increase in participation over time,CoT,"The chosen label ""Increase in participation over time"" encompasses both provided phrases while also being clear and broadly applicable. It captures the essence of a temporal increase in participation without being tied to a specific starting point, which makes it semantically inclusive of various contexts where these phrases might be used.

It is clear and has broad semantic coverage, as it implies the act of depicting, demonstrating, or being an example of risk, which can encompass both illustrating and representing. The term ""risk"" rather than ""risks"" is preferred in the canonical label for its general applicability, as it can refer to one or more instances of risk without limiting the scope."

The label is also free of additional context (like ""had"") that might not be universally applicable, ensuring broad semantic coverage and general applicability. Both EDC and CESI proposed the same label, which suggests a consensus on its suitability. The CoT label is discarded because the quotation marks are unnecessary and do not add to the semantic clarity of the label."

The phrase ""comprise"" is already a standard term used to indicate that something is made up of or includes the components mentioned. The term ""Consist of"" suggested by CoT is also semantically similar, but it is not identical in usage to ""comprise."" ""Comprise"" can imply that the whole includes the parts, which is a slight nuance that ""consist of"" does not always capture.

It specifies that the relation is about a percentage, which implies a share, and it includes the temporal aspect (""for a given year"") which is present in both original phrases. Additionally, the use of ""total GDP"" helps to clarify that it's a combined share, which aligns with the semantic meaning of the second phrase. Overall, it is the most explicit and inclusive option among the three candidates."
1851,1851,"- impact start
- impact start on",impact start,Initiate Impact,impact start,Initiate Impact,CoT,"The phrase ""Initiate Impact"" seems to capture the essence of both ""impact start"" and ""impact start on"" by implying the beginning of an impact. It is clearer and more descriptive than ""impact start,"" which could be interpreted in a more passive way. ""Initiate Impact"" suggests an active process, which is likely the intended meaning behind the original phrases. It also has a broad semantic coverage that can apply to various contexts where an impact is being started or triggered."

- time influence",influence time,Influence of Time,influence time,Influence of Time,CoT,"The label ""Influence of Time"" provides a clearer and more grammatically complete representation of the relationship between the concepts of ""influence"" and ""time."" It suggests that time is the influencing factor, which is a broad and semantically rich interpretation that can be widely applicable in various contexts. The preposition ""of"" helps to clarify the direction of the relationship, indicating that it is time that exerts influence, rather than influence existing within a timeframe. This makes it a more precise and descriptive label for the relation phrases provided."

It covers the notion of an indirect effect, which is common to both phrases, and is applicable in a broad range of contexts where an indirect relationship is being expressed. The alternative ""Causes indirectly through"" introduces the word ""causes,"" which may imply a more direct causation than what is suggested by the original phrases and may not be as broadly applicable to all instances where the original phrases might be used.

""Period of Adjustment"" is also a suitable label, but it is slightly less direct than ""adjustment time"" due to the addition of the word ""Period,"" which may not be necessary for representing the concept. Therefore, ""adjustment time"" is chosen for its straightforwardness and exact match to one of the phrases."
1865,1865,"- adjustments occurred through

It is broad enough to encompass various types of adjustments (not just those that are ""undergone"" or ""occurred"") and implies a causal relationship, which is a common theme in both original phrases. It is also clear and general enough to be applicable to a wide range of scenarios where an entity has experienced some form of change."

It maintains the core idea of adjusting something to ensure a particular outcome, which is a common thread among all the phrases. The label is clear, broad enough to cover variations in the phrases, and generally applicable to different contexts where these actions might take place.

It also maintains a formal tone that is suitable for a wide range of contexts within a knowledge graph. The use of ""Adaptation"" as a noun makes the label broad enough to encompass the various ways in which the original phrases might be used semantically. It avoids the specificity of ""to"" in ""needs adaptation to,"" which may not always be relevant, and it is more grammatically complete than ""need adaptation,"" which lacks a subject."

The addition of ""is"" in ""status is"" does not add significant semantic value and can be considered redundant for the purpose of a canonical label. The label ""status"" also has general applicability and can be easily understood in various contexts where the status of an entity is being described. The use of quotation marks in """"Status"""" by CoT does not enhance the semantic meaning and is not a standard practice for canonical labels in knowledge graphs.

It is clear and concise, and it covers the semantic meaning of all the given phrases. ""Be within"" is more ambiguous because ""be"" can represent multiple tenses and is less specific. ""Is Within"" with capital letters (as proposed by CoT) is not chosen because in English, prepositions are typically not capitalized in titles or labels unless they are the first or last word.

It uses the preposition ""at"" which is more broadly applicable and less formal than ""to counteract,"" making it more versatile for general use. Additionally, it avoids the past tense ""aimed"" alone, which could imply a completed action rather than an ongoing effort, and it does not specify ""combat,"" which might be too aggressive or specific for some contexts.

The phrase ""Indicates a past or habitual action or purpose"" from CoT is not suitable as it introduces a different meaning associated with the grammatical construction ""used to"" for past habits, which is not reflected in the original phrases. The CESI label is identical to the EDC label, and since both are equally clear and applicable, either could be chosen.

It is clear and has the broadest semantic coverage, as it implies both the state of being prepared and the potential for action, which aligns with the varying degrees of specificity in the original phrases. ""Plan to adjust at"" implies a more specific intent, which is also covered by the more general term ""make adjustments.""

It is clear and directly reflects the action of responding, which is common to both original phrases. ""Responsiveness to"" is more of a noun form and may not be as broadly applicable to all contexts where the relation might be used. ""Responding to"" changes the tense to a continuous form, which might imply an ongoing action rather than a state or characteristic, which could be less fitting in some contexts.

- driven up",driven up,Drive an increase,has been driven up for,Drive an increase,CoT,"The label ""Drive an increase"" is the most clear and broadly applicable representation of all the given phrases. It captures the essence of an upward movement or increase being actively caused, which is the common theme across all the phrases. It is also in an active voice, which is more generally applicable than the passive constructions in the other options. The phrase ""has been driven up for"" is too specific and includes a preposition that may not always be relevant. ""Driven up"" is concise but lacks the active agent implied in the other phrases. Therefore, ""Drive an increase"" is the best choice as it encompasses the meaning of causing an increase in a clear and general way."
1917,1917,"- growing more strongly
- growing strongly",growing strongly,Strong Growth,growing more strongly,growing strongly,CESI,"The phrase ""growing strongly"" is broad enough to encompass both the specific phrase ""growing more strongly"" and the general idea of ""strong growth"" without implying a comparison or degree of growth. It is clear, concise, and directly reflects the action described in the original phrases. It also maintains the verb ""growing,"" which is important for indicating the dynamic nature of the relation. ""Strong Growth"" is a nominalization that loses the active sense of ""growing,"" and ""growing more strongly"" implies a comparison that may not always be applicable."
1918,1918,"- drives
- Drive
- drive",drive,Drive,drives,drive,CoT,"The label ""drive"" is in its base form, which is typically preferred for canonical representations because it is the infinitive form of the verb. This form is more flexible and can be easily adapted to different grammatical contexts, making it broadly applicable and semantically inclusive of the variations ""drives"" and ""Drive."" Additionally, using lowercase is a common convention in knowledge graphs for consistency and ease of comparison."
1919,1919,"- typically drives
- also drives",typically drives,Frequently Drives,typically drives,Frequently Drives,CoT,"The label ""Frequently Drives"" encompasses both ""typically drives"" and ""also drives"" by indicating a regular occurrence without implying exclusivity or a normative standard. It suggests a high frequency which is a commonality between the given phrases, thus providing broad semantic coverage and general applicability."
1920,1920,"- modified due to
- reason to modify",reason to modify,Modified due to,modified due to,"""modified due to""",CoT,"The phrase ""modified due to"" captures the causal relationship implied by the original phrases. It suggests that a modification has occurred as a result of some reason or cause, which is a broad and clear way to represent the concept of change due to an influencing factor. The phrase ""reason to modify"" could imply intention to change rather than the change itself, making it slightly less representative of the actual modification. Therefore, ""modified due to"" is chosen for its direct reference to the change and its cause, providing both clarity and comprehensive semantic coverage."
1921,1921,"- plays a smaller role in
- plays smaller role in year",plays a smaller role in,Plays a minor role in,plays a smaller role in,Plays a minor role in,CoT,"The phrase ""Plays a minor role in"" captures the essence of both ""plays a smaller role in"" and ""plays smaller role in year"" by indicating a reduced level of importance or influence within a context, which could be temporal (as in ""year"") or more general. The word ""minor"" is a clear and succinct synonym for ""smaller"" that is broadly applicable and semantically inclusive of both original phrases. Additionally, the capitalization of ""Plays"" is not necessary for canonical labels, but it does not detract from its suitability."
1922,1922,"- should mainly be driven by
- should be driven by",should be driven by,"""is primarily influenced by""",should mainly be driven by,"""should be driven by""",CESI,"The phrase ""should be driven by"" captures the essence of the given relation phrases while maintaining broad semantic coverage and general applicability. It is clear and concise, and it includes the core idea of being ""driven by"" something without the specificity of ""mainly"" or ""primarily,"" which may not apply to all instances in the knowledge graph. The CESI label is more inclusive and can represent cases where the driving factor is not the main one, thus covering a wider range of potential relationships."
1923,1923,"- mainly driven by
- mostly driven by",mainly driven by,primarily driven by,mainly driven by,primarily driven by,CoT,"The label ""primarily driven by"" encompasses the meaning of both ""mainly driven by"" and ""mostly driven by"" effectively. It implies a sense of being the chief or main cause, which is what both phrases are conveying. The word ""primarily"" is also commonly used in various contexts and is easily understood, thus providing broad semantic coverage and general applicability. While ""mainly driven by"" is also a good match, ""primarily"" is slightly more inclusive and may be seen as a more neutral choice that captures the essence of both given phrases."
1924,1924,"- driven
- drove",driven,Drive,driven,Drive,CoT,"The label ""Drive"" is in the base form of the verb, which generally allows for broader semantic coverage and applicability. It encompasses both ""driven"" and ""drove,"" which are different tenses of the same verb. Using the infinitive form without the ""to"" (as in ""to drive"") makes it more adaptable as a canonical label for various uses in a knowledge graph. It is clear and succinct, and it can easily represent actions in the past, present, and future, making it a more versatile choice for representing the given relation phrases."
1925,1925,"- mentioned policy measures
- policy measures aim at",mentioned policy measures,"""Addressing Policy Measures""",mentioned policy measures,"""Addressing Policy Measures""",CoT,"The label ""Addressing Policy Measures"" seems to capture the essence of both phrases ""mentioned policy measures"" and ""policy measures aim at"" by implying that the policy measures are being discussed or targeted in some way. It is broader than just ""mentioned"" and incorporates the intent or goal-oriented aspect of ""aim at,"" thus providing a more inclusive representation of the actions related to policy measures. The term ""addressing"" can cover both the act of mentioning and the purposeful direction of policy measures."
1926,1926,"- was driven by
- is driven by",is driven by,Is driven by,was driven by,is driven by,CESI,"The label ""is driven by"" is in the present tense, which generally has broader semantic coverage and can be considered more timeless and applicable across various contexts. It encompasses both ongoing and past events, as the present tense can be used to describe habitual actions or general truths. Additionally, the label ""is driven by"" is in lowercase, which is more consistent with standard conventions in knowledge graphs where relation phrases are typically not capitalized unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. Therefore, it is the most appropriate choice for representing the given relation phrases."
1927,1927,"- driven by
- Driven by",driven by,driven by,driven by,"""driven by""",EDC,"All three candidate labels are identical and correctly capture the semantic meaning of the given phrases, which only differ in capitalization. Since capitalization does not alter the semantic meaning and the phrases are otherwise identical, any of the labels would serve as a suitable canonical form. However, the label ""driven by"" is chosen because it is presented in lowercase, which is a common practice for canonical labels in knowledge graphs to ensure consistency and avoid duplication based on case differences."
1928,1928,"- led to a smaller drop in
- led to smaller drop in",led to smaller drop in,"""Led to a smaller decrease in""",led to a smaller drop in,"""led to a smaller decrease in""",CoT,"The chosen label encompasses the meaning of both original phrases by using the word ""decrease,"" which is synonymous with ""drop"" and thus maintains the semantic integrity of the relation. Additionally, the inclusion of ""a"" before ""smaller"" makes the phrase grammatically complete and universally applicable, ensuring clarity and broad semantic coverage."
1929,1929,"- experienced negative growth
- negative growth in",experienced negative growth,Negative growth,experienced negative growth,Negative growth,CoT,"The label ""Negative growth"" is concise and captures the core meaning of both phrases without unnecessary detail. It is broadly applicable and semantically clear, representing the concept of growth being negative without the need for the additional context provided by ""experienced."" This makes it a more general label that can be applied across various contexts where the concept of negative growth is discussed."
1930,1930,"- released in
- released on
- released",released in,Released,released in,Released,CoT,"The label ""Released"" is the most general and broadly applicable term that encompasses all variations of the phrases given. It maintains the core meaning without the specificity of prepositions like ""in"" or ""on,"" which may not always be necessary or applicable. This choice allows for flexibility and clarity without losing the essential semantic information."
1931,1931,"- holds promise for containment
- promises containment of",holds promise for containment,Guarantees Containment,holds promise for containment,holds promise for containment,EDC,"The phrases ""holds promise for containment"" and ""promises containment of"" both suggest a potential or likelihood of achieving containment rather than an absolute guarantee. The word ""promise"" indicates a strong possibility or expectation, but not a certainty. The label ""Guarantees Containment"" proposed by CoT changes the meaning by implying a definite outcome, which is not conveyed by the original phrases. Therefore, the label ""holds promise for containment"" is chosen as it maintains the original intent and semantic meaning of the phrases, reflecting clarity and broad semantic coverage without altering the level of certainty expressed."
1932,1932,"- smaller share in
- has smaller share in
- has lower share of",has smaller share in,"""Has a smaller share in""",smaller share in,"""has smaller share in""",CESI,"The label ""has smaller share in"" strikes a balance between being concise and semantically complete. It includes the verb ""has,"" which is important for indicating possession or association, and it omits the article ""a,"" which is not necessary for the understanding of the relation and is not present in two out of the three original phrases. This label maintains the core meaning while being applicable in a broad range of contexts, making it suitable for a canonical representation of the given relation phrases."
1933,1933,"- has smaller contribution
- less contribution than",has smaller contribution,Contributes less,has smaller contribution,Contributes less,CoT,"The label ""Contributes less"" is succinct and captures the essence of both given phrases without being tied to a specific grammatical structure. It is clear and broadly applicable to various contexts where one entity is contributing less than another, which makes it a good canonical label for representing the semantic similarity of the given relation phrases."
1934,1934,"- driver of

It is broad enough to cover all variations of the relationship and is generally applicable to different contexts where this relationship might be used. The inclusion of quotation marks by CoT is unnecessary for the canonical label itself, so the version proposed by EDC is the most suitable."
1935,1935,"- drivers of
- are drivers of",are drivers of,"""drivers of""",drivers of,"""drivers of""",CoT,"The label ""drivers of"" is clear and concise, and it captures the essence of the relation without the additional verb ""are,"" which could be considered redundant in the context of a canonical label for a knowledge graph. It has broad semantic coverage and can be generally applied to various subjects without altering its meaning, making it the most suitable choice among the options provided."
1936,1936,"- average rate in
- actual rate in",average rate in,"""Specific rate in context""",average rate in,"""Specific rate in context""",CoT,"The label ""Specific rate in context"" is more inclusive and can represent both ""average rate in"" and ""actual rate in"" as it does not specify the nature of the rate (average or actual) but rather indicates that a rate is being specified within a context. This choice provides a broader semantic coverage and can be applied to various situations where a specific rate is mentioned, making it a more general and flexible label than the other two options, which are limited to the concept of an ""average rate."""
1937,1937,"- turned more negative by
- became more negative by
- became more negative",became more negative by,Became more negative,turned more negative by,Became more negative,CoT,"The label ""Became more negative"" is the most general and broadly applicable of the three options. It captures the essence of a change towards a more negative state without specifying the mechanism of change (i.e., ""by""), which makes it semantically inclusive of all the given phrases. It is clear and succinct, and it avoids the additional preposition ""by"" that is not present in all the original phrases, thus making it a more flexible representation."
1938,1938,"- has publication date
- has publication year",has publication date,"""Has Publication Date""",has publication date,"""has publication date""",CoT,"The label ""has publication date"" is chosen because it encompasses both specific dates and years, offering broad semantic coverage that can apply to various types of publication time-related information. It is also written in lowercase, which is a common convention in knowledge graphs for consistency and ease of processing. The label from CoT includes unnecessary quotation marks and capitalization, which might not align with standard naming conventions in knowledge graphs. Therefore, the label from CESI and EDC is preferred, and between the two, since they are identical, either could be chosen. Here, CESI is selected arbitrarily as both CESI and EDC labels are equally suitable."
1939,1939,"- described as negative in
- negative in",negative in,"""Depicted as negative in""",described as negative in,"""negative in""",CESI,"The label ""negative in"" is concise, clear, and captures the essential meaning of both given phrases without being overly specific or adding additional connotations. ""Described as negative in"" is more specific and includes an aspect of description, which may not be necessary for all applications. ""Depicted as negative in"" adds a visual connotation that is not present in the original phrases. Therefore, ""negative in"" is the most broadly applicable and semantically representative of the group."
1940,1940,"- date of release
- released on date",date of release,Release Date,date of release,Release Date,CoT,"The label ""Release Date"" is concise and immediately recognizable, reflecting the common terminology used in various domains to indicate when a product, film, software, etc., was made available to the public. It encompasses the meaning of both ""date of release"" and ""released on date"" while being more succinct and widely applicable. It is also the form most commonly used in everyday language, which enhances its clarity and general applicability."
1941,1941,"- indicate response of
- signaled response to",indicate response of,"""Indicate reaction to""",indicate response of,"""Indicate reaction to""",CoT,"The chosen label ""Indicate reaction to"" captures the essence of both given phrases by encompassing both 'response' and 'reaction', which are semantically similar. The preposition 'to' is more universally applicable than 'of', as it implies a direction towards something, which is a common way to express a reaction in English. The label is clear, broad in semantic coverage, and generally applicable to various contexts where an entity is showing a reaction or response to another entity or event."
1942,1942,"- action required
- action needed
- requires action during
- requires action at",action required,"""Requires Action""",action required,"""Requires Action""",CoT,"The label ""Requires Action"" is broad enough to encompass all the given phrases while maintaining clarity. It captures the essence that an action is necessary without being tied to a specific tense or context, such as a location or time frame, which makes it generally applicable across various scenarios. ""Action required"" is also a good candidate, but it is slightly more passive and less imperative than ""Requires Action,"" which directly implies that something must be done."
1943,1943,"- reason for action
- cause for action",reason for action,"""Cause for Action""",reason for action,"""reason for action""",CESI,"The phrase ""reason for action"" is more inclusive and broadly applicable as it encompasses a wider variety of motivating factors, not just causal ones. While ""cause"" implies a direct and perhaps more mechanical or deterministic relationship, ""reason"" can refer to causes, motivations, justifications, or purposes, thus covering the semantic range of both given phrases. Therefore, ""reason for action"" is the best label to represent the group of semantically similar relation phrases."

It directly reflects the concept of a change or alteration to a projection, which is a common denominator in all the phrases. ""Projection revision"" might imply a more specific type of change, such as an update or correction, while ""Projection Modification"" (with unnecessary quotation marks and capitalization) could be seen as a more formal or less common way of expressing the same idea. Therefore, ""projection change"" is the most clear and generally applicable label."

It captures the essence of the change to a negative state without specifying a cause or a time, which makes it applicable to all the given phrases. It is also clear and concise, which is beneficial for a canonical label in a knowledge graph. The other candidates, ""turned negative in"" and ""turned negative due to,"" include additional words that limit their applicability to specific contexts (i.e., a particular time or a cause), which are not common to all the given phrases."
1946,1946,"- Published in Year
- published in year",Published in Year,Year of Publication,Published in Year,Year of Publication,CoT,"The label ""Year of Publication"" is clear, concise, and accurately encompasses the semantic meaning of the given phrases. It directly refers to the year when something was published, which is the underlying concept of both ""Published in Year"" and ""published in year."" This label is also in a noun phrase format, which is generally more suitable for representing relationships in a knowledge graph as it denotes an attribute of an entity. Additionally, it avoids potential ambiguity that might arise from different capitalization practices, as seen in the given phrases."
1947,1947,"- publish year
- publication date

It directly refers to the year in which a publication was made, which is the essential information conveyed by all the phrases. ""Publish year"" is less formal and could be interpreted as the year something was created rather than made publicly available. ""Year of Publication"" is clear but slightly more verbose and less commonly used in database fields and programming contexts, where brevity and standard terminology are often preferred. Therefore, ""publication year"" strikes the best balance between clarity, semantic coverage, and general applicability."
1948,1948,"- documented
- documented in

The phrase ""documented"" alone does not specify where the documentation occurs, and ""Is Documented In"" is more specific but less grammatically flexible than ""documented in."" Therefore, ""documented in"" offers a balance between specificity and applicability, making it the best choice to represent the given phrases."

It covers the concept of possession implied in ""has number"" and ""is number of,"" while also being applicable to the broader context implied by ""related to number of"" and ""number of."" The alternatives either add unnecessary words (""related to"" and ""associated with"") that may not always be applicable or imply a more specific relationship that may not fit all cases. ""Has number of"" strikes a balance between brevity and semantic coverage, making it a suitable canonical label for these phrases."
1950,1950,"- was negative since
- negative since",negative since,"""Has been negative since""",was negative since,"""negative since""",CESI,"The label ""negative since"" captures the essence of the relation phrases without the additional complexity of tense or aspect that ""was negative since"" and ""Has been negative since"" introduce.

It is clear and concise, and it has general applicability to different scenarios where the state of being negative continues. Additionally, it avoids the more specific phrase ""negative territory,"" which could be interpreted as more domain-specific, and it is more succinct than ""Continued to be negative,"" which makes it a broadly applicable label for the given relation phrases."

The phrase ""caused by containment"" suggests a causative relationship that is also related to the concept of containment. Therefore, ""containment of"" has broad semantic coverage and general applicability to both given phrases, while also being clear and direct. The label ""Causative Containment"" proposed by CoT introduces a causative element that is not explicitly present in the second phrase ""containment of,"" which may limit its applicability."

The term ""enforced legal measures"" suggested by CoT is slightly different semantically, as ""enforced"" implies ensuring compliance with laws or rules that are already in place, rather than the act of implementing or enacting new measures.

It is general enough to be applicable to various contexts where an action is performed, regardless of who performs it. The phrase ""action by"" implies a specific actor, but ""action"" alone is more inclusive and can still represent instances where an actor is involved without necessitating it.

It also covers the semantic meaning of all the given phrases, indicating equivalence or identity between two entities. The inclusion of the auxiliary verb ""is"" helps to convey the meaning more precisely than the shorter ""is same as,"" and it avoids the specificity implied by ""is identical to,"" which could be interpreted as a stricter form of sameness. Therefore, ""is the same as"" is the most suitable canonical label for representing the given relation phrases."

It implies a sense of action and completion, which is suitable for the context of measures being actively put into place to contain something. The word ""implemented"" is more inclusive than ""introduced"" because it suggests that the measures are not only proposed but also executed. The label chosen by CESI and CoT is also in the past tense, which is appropriate for a knowledge graph that records events or actions that have occurred."

It is clear and specific, capturing the essence of a formal or official action being taken as a direct consequence of something. While ""initiated in response to"" is also a good fit semantically, it is slightly broader and could imply a wider range of actions beyond formal enactments.

It is also in a natural word order that is commonly used and understood in English. The use of lowercase is consistent with the general convention in knowledge graphs for relation phrases, which often do not capitalize each word. This label has broad semantic coverage and is generally applicable to various contexts where the concept of rebound time might be relevant."

It covers scenarios where a specific time frame is not mentioned (""experienced recovery""), as well as instances where a time frame is specified (""experienced recovery in"" and ""experienced recovery during""). By not including the preposition ""in,"" the label remains applicable to a broader range of contexts while still capturing the essence of the relation phrases.

It directly implies that something is at the beginning of something else, which is the common semantic thread between the given phrases. Additionally, it uses common language that is easily understood and recognized, making it the best choice for a canonical label representing the group of relation phrases."

It is broad enough to encompass the various ways in which support can be provided, whether it is ongoing (""supports recovery""), has occurred in the past (""supported recovery of""), or is part of a reciprocal process (""recovers with support""). Additionally, it avoids the passive voice found in ""recovery supported by"" and ""supported recovery of,"" which can be less direct and more ambiguous.

It maintains the natural language order that is typically used when expressing such relationships, making it broadly understandable and applicable. The phrase ""before date"" could potentially be ambiguous, as it could be interpreted as something occurring before a date is set or known, rather than indicating a clear temporal sequence. ""Date Before"" with capitalization (as in CoT's suggestion) is less conventional for labels in knowledge graphs where typically only the first word or proper nouns are capitalized. Therefore, ""date before"" is the most straightforward and semantically clear choice."

The label ""introduced before"" has broad semantic coverage and is generally applicable to various contexts where the concept of prior introduction is relevant. The label ""Introduced Earlier"" proposed by CoT is also a valid representation, but it is slightly less direct than ""introduced before,"" which uses the exact wording found in one of the original phrases. The EDC's choice of ""introduction before"" is less preferable because it is less commonly used in natural language to describe this relationship."

It is the base form of the verb, which makes it general enough to encompass all variations of the action without being tied to a specific subject or object as the other options are. The term ""anticipates"" is also a good candidate, but it is in the third-person singular form, which could imply a specific subject. The phrase ""serve to anticipate"" is more complex and less generalizable than the base verb.

It retains the core action of collection without specifying the prepositional context, which varies among the original phrases. This makes it semantically flexible to represent different scenarios where items could be collected from a source, at a location, or up to a certain point in time or quantity. Both ""collected from"" and ""collected at"" imply specific contexts that may not universally apply to all instances of the relation, whereas ""Collected"" is general enough to cover all bases without losing the essential meaning."

It implies a forecast or prediction, which is a common theme across all the phrases. ""Expected"" is a term that is widely understood and used in various contexts, making it broadly applicable and clear to a general audience. It also has a semantic breadth that covers both the connotations of ""anticipated"" and ""projected,"" which can be seen as more specific instances of expectation."
2039,2039,"- is expected to recover over

It captures the essence of measuring or determining the extent or scope of something without specifying what that something is, making it applicable to a wide range of contexts. The label ""determines extent of effect"" is more specific and excludes cases where the extent of something other than an effect is being determined. The CoT label ""Evaluates the magnitude of impact"" introduces new terminology (""Evaluates"" and ""magnitude of impact"") that, while semantically similar, is not an exact match for the language used in the given phrases."

Both ""implement"" and ""implement by"" indicate an action of carrying out or executing a plan, policy, system, or idea, and the word ""implement"" captures the essence of this action without the additional preposition ""by,"" which could be implied. The label from CoT, ""Implement,"" is semantically identical but uses a capital ""I,"" which is not necessary and could imply a proper noun or a beginning of a sentence, which is not the intended use in a knowledge graph relation. Therefore, ""implement"" from CESI and EDC is the best label for its simplicity and semantic coverage."

It is clear and broad enough to encompass the meaning of ""have helped to alleviate"" and ""alleviates impact on,"" while also being applicable in a general context. The verb ""alleviate"" is central to both phrases, and ""impact"" is a key noun that represents the effect or consequence being mitigated. The chosen label is also in the present tense, which is typically preferred for canonical labels as it suggests an ongoing or general action. Additionally, it avoids the use of auxiliary verbs and prepositions, making it more streamlined and adaptable as a canonical label."
2054,2054,"- implementation of
- for implementation of",for implementation of,Implementation,implementation of,implementation of,EDC,"The phrase ""implementation of"" is clear and directly represents the action of putting something into effect, which is the core idea shared by both given phrases. It is broad enough to cover the semantic meaning of ""for implementation of"" while maintaining general applicability across various contexts where these phrases might be used. The preposition ""for"" in the second phrase is not necessary to convey the essential meaning and can be considered implicit, making ""implementation of"" the most concise and representative choice."

It is broad enough to cover the semantic range of ""opposing"" and ""against"" while remaining directly applicable to a wide variety of contexts within a knowledge graph. ""Opposing"" is also a valid choice, but the simpler form ""oppose"" is more direct and versatile for canonical representation. ""Opposition"" changes the part of speech to a noun, which could potentially limit its applicability in certain relational contexts where a verb is more appropriate."
2057,2057,"- assumes reaction of
- assumes reaction to",assumes reaction of,Assumes reaction to,assumes reaction of,"""assumes reaction to""",CoT,"The preposition ""to"" generally indicates a direction towards something or someone, which in this context can be understood as a more general and broad representation of a reaction directed towards an event, action, or entity. The phrase ""assumes reaction to"" can be interpreted to encompass the idea of ""assumes reaction of"" as well, since the reaction is inherently related to something. Therefore, ""Assumes reaction to"" can be seen as slightly more inclusive and representative of the relationship between the entity assuming and the entity to which the reaction is directed. Additionally, the capitalization of the first word is not necessary for canonical labels, but it does not detract from the semantic coverage of the phrase."

2061,2061,"- experienced the strongest increase in
- experience strongest increases in",experienced the strongest increase in,"""Experiences significant growth in""",experienced the strongest increase in,"""Experiences significant growth in""",CoT,"The chosen label captures the essence of both phrases by indicating a notable upward trend without limiting the scope to the ""strongest"" increase, which may not always apply. It uses the present tense ""experiences,"" which is more general and can be applied to ongoing situations, making it broadly applicable.

It uses more general terms, making it broadly applicable to various contexts where the original phrases might be used. The word ""reduce"" is a more common synonym for ""minimise"" and may be more widely understood, while ""intention"" covers both ""aimed"" and ""intends,"" as well as the proactive ""focus on"" aspect of minimising.

It implies a sense of finality and destination, which can be applied to both temporal and spatial contexts. This makes it semantically rich and versatile for representing the various forms of ending mentioned in the list. While ""ends"" is also a strong candidate, ""ends in"" provides a slightly more specific connotation that can encompass the idea of ending at a particular place or time, which is implied in many of the phrases. ""Ends"" could be seen as slightly more ambiguous because it might not always imply a specific endpoint. Therefore, ""ends in"" offers a balance of clarity and broad semantic coverage."

""Jeopardized by"" is specific to situations where the jeopardy has already occurred, while ""Threaten stability"" is a more abstract and less direct way of expressing the relationship, which could limit its semantic coverage in a knowledge graph context.

The preposition ""to"" is more general than ""for,"" as it implies direction or destination, which can be applied to a variety of contexts (e.g., risk to health, risk to the environment, risk to the economy). Additionally, the singular ""risk"" is preferred over ""risks"" for canonical labels as it allows for a more general representation that can encompass multiple risks without being grammatically specific to plural instances."

- signal of",signal for,Signal by,Signal by,signal for,CESI,"The phrase ""signal for"" seems to capture the essence of the relationship most broadly. It implies an intention or purpose behind the signal, which can be applicable in various contexts where one thing is indicating the need for or presence of something else. ""Signal by"" is more restrictive semantically, as it suggests the method or agent of signaling, which may not always be relevant. ""Signal of"" is also somewhat restrictive, as it implies a signal that is indicative of something else. Therefore, ""signal for"" is the most inclusive and representative label for the given phrases."

It is clear and general enough to be applicable to various contexts where any of the original phrases might be used. The phrase ""contributes to changes during"" is more specific and includes a temporal aspect that is not present in the other two phrases, so it is less suitable as a canonical label. The label ""contributes to difference"" is also represented well by ""contributes to change,"" as a difference is often the result of a change. The chosen label also avoids unnecessary capitalization, adhering to a more standard format for knowledge graph relations."

It covers both given phrases semantically without redundancy or unnecessary capitalization. The capitalization in ""Signals"" from CoT is not needed as labels are typically presented in lowercase unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence. Therefore, the label ""signals"" proposed by both EDC and CESI is the best representation."

- signal",Signal,Signal,Signal,Signal,EDC,"All three systems have proposed the same label with the only difference being the capitalization. Since the phrases are 'Signal' and 'signal', the canonical label should be able to represent both regardless of capitalization. The label ""Signal"" with a capital 'S' is a standard way to denote a proper noun or the start of a sentence, which can be more universally applicable and is typically used in knowledge graphs to represent concepts or entities.

The label from CoT, ""'Reported Impact'"", omits the preposition ""on,"" which could lead to ambiguity regarding what the impact is directed towards.

The choice of lowercase makes it more versatile for programmatic use, as it avoids potential issues with case sensitivity. The label ""Publish under"" from CoT introduces unnecessary capitalization, which could imply a proper noun or a title rather than a canonical label for a relationship. Therefore, ""publish under"" from EDC and CESI is the best choice, and between the two, either could be selected as they are identical.

The choice of ""Published in"" (with capitalization) over ""published in"" (without capitalization) is a matter of style, but since it is a label and could be considered a title, capitalization is acceptable.

- raises
- Raise",raise,Elevate,raise,raise,CESI,"The label ""raise"" directly matches the base form of the verb found in the given phrases, maintaining the original meaning without introducing synonyms that could potentially alter the semantic nuance. It is clear, directly applicable to all variations of the phrase (including different capitalizations), and covers the broad semantic range implied by the context of the phrases. Choosing ""Elevate"" as in CoT's suggestion could introduce a slightly different meaning, as ""elevate"" can imply a more formal or figurative action, whereas ""raise"" is more general and widely applicable. Therefore, ""raise"" is the most appropriate canonical label."
2176,2176,"- raised
- Raised",raised,Raise,raised,raised,CESI,"The label ""raised"" is in lowercase, which is generally more appropriate for canonical labels in knowledge graphs as it avoids unnecessary capitalization and maintains consistency. It is also in the past tense, which matches the given phrases semantically. The label ""Raise"" proposed by CoT is in the base form, which could be applicable, but since the given phrases are in the past tense, ""raised"" is a more accurate representation. Therefore, ""raised"" is the best choice as it reflects clarity, semantic coverage, and is applicable to the given phrases."

It also includes the potential for specific conditions or reasons as suggested by ""require monitoring due to."" The choice of ""requires"" over ""should"" or ""need"" suggests an imperative, which is appropriate for the context of monitoring, and the use of the present tense (""requires"" instead of ""required"") ensures general applicability. The label is clear, concise, and captures the essence of the obligation and ongoing nature of the monitoring process."
2179,2179,"- has very small impact from
- minimal impact on",minimal impact on,Has minimal impact on,has very small impact from,minimal impact on,CESI,"The phrase ""minimal impact on"" is concise and captures the essence of both provided phrases. It is clear and broadly applicable, as it does not specify a direction (from or on), making it versatile for use in various contexts within a knowledge graph. The phrase ""has very small impact from"" is less general due to the inclusion of ""from,"" which may not always be applicable. The CoT's ""Has minimal impact on"" is also a good candidate but is less concise due to the capitalized ""Has,"" which is unnecessary for a canonical label in a knowledge graph where labels are typically presented in a standardized format."

2181,2181,"- indicate subdued in context of
- indicate subdued due to",indicate subdued due to,"""Indicate subdued due to""",indicate subdued in context of,"""indicate subdued due to""",CESI,"The chosen label ""indicate subdued due to"" captures the causality implied in both phrases. It suggests that there is a reason or cause for something being subdued, which is a common semantic thread between the two original phrases. While ""indicate subdued in context of"" implies a broader setting or situation, it does not necessarily convey the causative aspect as directly as ""due to"" does. Therefore, ""indicate subdued due to"" is more precise in capturing the causal relationship and is likely to be more broadly applicable across different instances where these phrases might be used in a knowledge graph."

This form is more commonly used in descriptive contexts, which aligns with the purpose of relation phrases in a knowledge graph to describe the nature of the relationship between entities. The label from EDC and CoT is essentially the same, but the CoT label includes unnecessary quotation marks.

- partly explains",partly explains,Partially explains,partially explains,partially explains,CoT,"The phrase ""partially explains"" is a clear and direct representation of the concept that the relation phrases are trying to convey. It is also grammatically correct and has broad semantic coverage, as ""partially"" is a common adverb used to indicate that something is true or happens to some extent but not completely. This makes it generally applicable across different contexts. The choice of lowercase is in line with the typical formatting of relation phrases in knowledge graphs, which often do not capitalize such phrases unless they are proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence."

It clearly indicates a causal relationship where the cause is not the sole factor, which is the common semantic thread between the given phrases. The capitalization of the first letter is not a deciding factor, as it can be adjusted based on the context in which the label is used. However, the use of ""partially"" instead of ""partly"" can be seen as slightly more formal and thus may be preferred for a canonical label in a knowledge graph."

It maintains the comparative aspect indicated by ""more muted compared to"" and ""more muted due to,"" while also incorporating the potential conditional aspect of ""may be more muted in."" Additionally, the use of ""is"" helps to generalize the statement, making it applicable in a broader range of contexts, which is beneficial for a canonical label in a knowledge graph.

The phrase ""causes suffering to"" can encompass a wider variety of situations and is semantically clearer when identifying the party experiencing the suffering. The preposition ""in"" could imply a location or state, which might not always be relevant or clear in the context of suffering being inflicted upon an entity. Therefore, ""causes suffering to"" is the better choice for general applicability and semantic coverage."

While ""are mainly"" and ""are primarily"" are very close in meaning, ""primarily"" may be slightly more formal and encompassing, which could make it a better canonical label for representing a range of similar phrases in a knowledge graph. It is also less colloquial than ""mainly,"" which may be advantageous for formal or academic applications."
2194,2194,"- arose after
- arose ahead of",arose after,"""Occurred following""",arose after,"""Occurred following""",CoT,"The phrase ""Occurred following"" captures the essence of both ""arose after"" and ""arose ahead of"" by indicating a sequence where one event happens subsequent to another. It is clear and has a broad semantic coverage that can apply to various contexts where one thing happens as a consequence or in the sequence of another, without implying immediate succession, which makes it generally applicable. The other options are less inclusive, as ""arose after"" does not cover the nuance of ""arose ahead of"" adequately."

It covers the semantic meaning of all the given phrases, which include both past and present tenses, as well as variations with prepositions. The base form is typically used to represent the canonical form of a verb in linguistic resources, which supports its selection as the best label.

It is clear and generally applicable to various contexts where a limitation is not certain but possible under certain conditions. The phrase ""likely to be limited due to"" suggests a higher probability of limitation, which is not fully represented by the word ""might."" The CoT proposal ""Expected to be limited by"" implies a stronger expectation of limitation, which does not encompass the more tentative nature of ""might.""

The preposition ""of"" following ""in excess"" is important because it indicates what is being exceeded. While ""in excess"" is also a good candidate, adding ""of"" makes the phrase more complete and broadly applicable to different contexts where the relationship might be used. The label ""Exceeding"" proposed by CoT is also a good representation, but it is in a different grammatical form (a gerund) than the original phrases, which could lead to slight variations in meaning or usage.

The preposition ""of"" generally indicates possession or association, which can apply to a wide range of subjects. On the other hand, ""suggests stability in"" is more context-specific and may imply a location or environment where stability is observed (e.g., ""suggests stability in the market"").

Additionally, ""reaches amount of"" implies a threshold or specific quantity being achieved, which aligns well with the semantic meaning of the given phrases. The label ""Achieves Quantity"" proposed by CoT is also a strong candidate due to its clarity and broad semantic coverage; however, it is slightly more abstract than the more direct ""reaches amount of.""

The label ""Setting price"" captures this action-oriented aspect of both phrases, indicating the process of establishing a price. It is more descriptive and semantically rich than the simple ""price on,"" which could also be interpreted as a static state rather than an action. The label ""Setting price"" also has general applicability as it can be used in various contexts where pricing is being determined or assigned."

It captures the essence of both ""trend start"" and ""trend starts"" perfectly, as they are essentially the same phrase in singular and plural form. While ""initial trend"" slightly differs, it still implies the beginning of a trend, which ""trend start"" adequately represents. The label ""Initiation of trend"" proposed by CoT is also semantically correct but is less concise and uses a more complex word ""initiation,"" which may not be as immediately clear or as broadly applicable as the simpler ""trend start."""

It is general enough to cover instances where the strength of the ""despite"" relation is not emphasized (as in the simple ""despite"") and also specific instances where the strength is noted (as in ""strong despite""). The term ""strong despite"" is more specific and may not always be applicable when the strength of the relation is not a focus, thus ""Despite"" is the more inclusive choice.

The label ""Shielding"" proposed by CoT, while related, is a gerund and does not explicitly include the preposition ""from,"" which is important for specifying the directionality of the shielding action. Therefore, ""shielded from"" is the most precise and semantically representative label for the given phrases."

The label ""value in"" captures this relationship without the additional abstraction introduced by ""Is In State Of Value,"" which could potentially introduce ambiguity or confusion.

It implies a comparison where March is a reference point, which is a common element in all the phrases. The phrase ""compare march february"" is slightly less clear because it specifies February, but the canonical label does not need to specify both comparison points to be broadly applicable. ""Comparison with March"" is also more grammatically complete than ""compare march february"" and avoids the specificity of a particular year as in ""compared to March 2021,"" making it the most suitable choice for general applicability."

The capitalization helps to standardize the label and may help in distinguishing it as a specific relation in the graph.

The term ""direct"" in ""no direct impact on"" is more specific and excludes the broader sense of ""no impact"" which could be direct or indirect. ""Does not affect"" is also a good candidate, but it is slightly less clear than ""no impact on"" because ""affect"" can have a broader range of meanings in different contexts.

It is clear, concise, and semantically covers the action described by all the given phrases. The addition of ""to"" in one of the phrases does not fundamentally alter the meaning, and the process of assessment is implied to be directed at something, which is why the simpler form without ""to"" is still representative. The label ""Evaluate Contribution"" proposed by CoT changes the verb ""assess"" to ""evaluate,"" which, while synonymous, is not the exact term used in the original phrases.

It is also clear and concise, capturing the essence of dependency indicated by all the given phrases. ""Depended on"" is in the past tense, which may not be suitable for ongoing or future dependencies. ""Relied on"" is also past tense and does not convey the action as clearly as ""Relies on"" when considering potential ongoing or future scenarios.

Both ""has amount"" and ""had amount"" imply possession of a quantity, and the chosen label is in the present tense, which is generally more common and broadly applicable for canonical labels in knowledge representations. The label proposed by CoT, ""Possesses quantity at a certain time,"" while accurate, is more verbose and introduces a temporal element that may not be essential for all use cases.

The word ""assess"" implies a measurement or evaluation process, which is a common theme in all the phrases. Additionally, ""rate of decline"" is a clear and precise way to describe the concept of ""decline pace,"" making it broadly applicable and semantically rich. This label is also in a gerund form, which is more neutral and can fit different syntactical contexts, unlike the specific present continuous ""declining"" or the more passive ""have decline pace in."""

The phrase ""declined due to rising"" only captures the causative aspect of the decline but does not explicitly mention the contradiction implied by ""despite."" The CoT label ""Decreased despite increase in"" is also semantically similar, but the use of ""declined"" is more consistent with the original phrases and is a more formal choice of word than ""decreased.""

2763,2763,"- shows changes in
- indicates change in",indicates change in,Indicates changes in,shows changes in,"""indicates change in""",CESI,"The label ""indicates change in"" is chosen because it captures the essence of both phrases succinctly. The verb ""indicates"" is a more formal and widely applicable term compared to ""shows,"" and it implies a more deliberate action of pointing out a change. Additionally, using the singular ""change"" as opposed to ""changes"" allows for a broader interpretation, as it can encompass multiple changes or a single change, thus providing a more inclusive semantic coverage for the relation phrases."

Both ""evaluate"" and ""assess"" imply a process of judgment or determination of value, quality, or importance, and thus ""will evaluate"" can broadly cover the semantics of the given phrases.

It clearly indicates that there is a downward revision, and it is the result of some cause. The use of ""caused by"" is a common way to express causation, making it broadly applicable and easily understood. The label from EDC is chosen over CESI's because it is in the active voice, which is typically more direct and clearer. The CoT label is identical to EDC's but includes unnecessary quotation marks, which could be confusing in a canonical label.

It covers the semantic meaning of both ""revised status"" and ""revised status for"" without the additional preposition ""for,"" which may not be necessary in all contexts. The label ""Update Status"" proposed by CoT is also a good candidate, but it introduces a new word ""Update"" which is not present in the original phrases. ""revised status"" maintains the original terminology and is thus more accurate. CESI's ""revised status for"" is also accurate but the preposition ""for"" might limit its applicability in some contexts where the preposition is not required.

It maintains the core meaning without the temporal aspect suggested by ""when,"" which might not always be relevant. It is also more grammatically versatile than ""Surpassing,"" which is a present participle and might not fit all contexts where the past tense or a noun form is needed.

It is clear and broadly applicable to various contexts where a threshold, level, or limit is being surpassed. The use of the base form of the verb ""exceed"" makes it applicable to past, present, and future instances, and the word ""Threshold"" is a more general term than ""level,"" which can be specific to certain contexts.

The preposition ""despite"" is crucial as it indicates that the solidity is in spite of some potentially adverse conditions, which is a key aspect of the semantic meaning in all the phrases.

While ""since the start of"" is also a good candidate, ""since the beginning of"" is slightly more inclusive as it implies the very inception, which can be synonymous with ""onset,"" thereby covering the semantic range of ""began since"" as well."

The word ""indicates"" is more definitive and widely applicable than ""suggests,"" which can imply a less certain connection. The preposition ""in"" from the phrase ""suggests deterioration in"" is not necessary for the canonical label, as the relationship of deterioration does not require a preposition to be understood in a knowledge graph context.

It captures the essence of causality clearly and is directly related to the original phrases without the addition of capitalization or extra words. The label ""Cause"" proposed by CoT could also work, but it is a noun form, while ""because"" is more often used as a conjunction, which is more appropriate for expressing relationships between clauses or events in a knowledge graph.

It is a clear and general term that can encompass various contexts implied by the phrases, such as the simple state of worsening, the experience of worsening, and the causative aspect of worsening due to certain factors. The label ""worsening"" is also a good fit, but it is less formal and slightly narrower in scope. ""Worsening due to"" is too specific as it implies causation, which is not a necessary component of all the given phrases.

It maintains the past tense form, which is semantically relevant to the action described by the relation phrases. The capitalization of the first letter does not alter the meaning but gives the label a standardized form that might be preferable for use as a canonical label in a knowledge graph. ""Provide"" changes the tense and thus could slightly alter the semantic meaning, and the lowercase ""provided"" lacks the standardized capitalization that might be preferred for named entities or labels in a knowledge graph."

It covers both the notion of an outcome being expected and the implication that it leads to something, without the additional verb ""leads to"" which is more specific and may not be applicable in all cases. The label provided by CESI and the one with quotation marks from CoT are essentially the same, but the simpler formatting without quotation marks is more universally applicable and avoids potential confusion or formatting issues in different systems.

Additionally, the use of quotation marks in CoT's suggestion is unnecessary for a canonical label, and the inclusion of 'of' in one of the phrases is adequately covered by the preposition 'into,' which implies the expansion of something into something else.

It maintains the original passive voice found in two of the phrases and implies an agent that could perform the action, which is also implied in the phrase ""could widen."" The label proposed by CoT, ""Could be made wider,"" while semantically similar, introduces the word ""made,"" which slightly shifts the focus from the act of widening to the result of being made wider.

The choice of ""directed at"" over ""Directed at"" is due to the standard convention of using lowercase for general labels in knowledge graphs, which makes them more consistent and easier to handle programmatically.

The use of both ""due to"" and ""comparison"" ensures that the label is applicable in various contexts where either causation or comparison (or both) is the focus. The labels proposed by CESI and EDC, ""increased less compared to,"" capture the comparative aspect but omit the causal aspect, which is present in one of the original phrases.

It implies that one event or action has led to the growth or increase in another area, which is the common theme in both phrases. The word ""in"" also suggests that the expansion is within a specific domain or context, which is a detail present in the second phrase ""led to expansion in"" and is a useful semantic detail for a canonical label.

The label ""Remain High"" from CoT is semantically identical, but the choice of all initial capitals does not conform to standard capitalization rules in English and may imply emphasis or a heading, which is not necessary in this case.

""Increase"" by CoT is also a good candidate, but it is a noun, while the given phrases suggest a verb form is more appropriate.

It encompasses both singular and plural subjects (e.g., ""it occurs over"" or ""they occur over"") and is not constrained by tense or aspect, making it the most flexible for representing the given phrases. It also avoids the specificity of ""occurs over,"" which is limited to the third person singular present tense, and the potential uncertainty introduced by ""might occur over."" Additionally, the label does not include unnecessary punctuation, such as the quotation marks in CoT's proposal, which could complicate its use in a knowledge graph context."

It is broad enough to cover various contexts where a decline might occur, yet specific enough to convey the intended meaning of a sequence where something happens subsequent to a decline. Both EDC and CESI proposed this label, and it seems to be the most appropriate choice for representing the given relation phrases in a knowledge graph."

- decline after",Decline after,Decline after,Decline after,Decline after,CESI,"All three systems have proposed the same label with the only difference being the capitalization of the first letter. Since relation phrases in knowledge graphs are often not case-sensitive and the meaning does not change with capitalization, any of the labels would be semantically correct. However, choosing ""Decline after"" with the capitalization of the first letter is a common practice for labels representing titles or proper nouns, which can help in distinguishing this label as a specific relation in the knowledge graph. Therefore, ""Decline after"" is chosen for its clarity and adherence to standard conventions in data representation."

This label is more general and semantically rich than the other two options, which are simply repetitions of one of the given phrases and do not encapsulate the bidirectional nature of the relationship (i.e., before and after a decrease). The chosen label is also free from any syntactic ambiguity and is broadly applicable to various contexts where the timing of a decrease is relevant."

It is clear and broadly applicable to various events or situations that can be described by the relation phrases. The term ""occurred when"" is more specific and includes a temporal aspect that may not always be relevant, while ""Occurred"" with a capital ""O"" does not add semantic value and is inconsistent with standard capitalization rules for relation phrases in knowledge graphs."

The phrase ""increase area"" is slightly different in meaning, but it can still be related to the concept of an area being affected by expansion. The label ""represents area of"" is also a strong contender, but it may imply a more passive or representational connection rather than an active or causal one. ""Area Operations"" suggested by CoT is less fitting because it implies active management or function, which does not align as closely with all the given phrases.

The other two labels are more specific and do not capture the full range of activities implied by the three phrases. ""Has notable assets"" is limited to possession and does not imply management, while ""includes asset categories"" suggests classification but not necessarily ownership or management.

The other two labels, ""facing by time"" and ""facing by time"" (which are identical), are more specific and seem to imply a temporal component, which may not fully represent the ""agreed facing"" phrase.

The label ""after incident"" captures the essence of a temporal sequence or consequence without the specificity of ""determined,"" making it broadly applicable and semantically inclusive of the given phrases. The choice of CESI and EDC's label reflects this reasoning.

It provides a broader semantic coverage that can apply to various contexts where something is being regained, whether it is control, status, or another form of restitution.

It captures the essence of a hierarchical relationship implied by both phrases. The labels ""primary over"" and ""EDC"" are more specific and less abstract, potentially limiting their applicability to a wider range of relationships that could be described by the term ""Primary Dominance.""

It is clear and general enough to apply to various scenarios where an action is a result of a deliberative process.

It conveys the sense of reluctance or uncertainty that is present in each original phrase. ""Avoids encouraging"" suggests a more active avoidance, which might not fully encompass the nuance of ""uncertain in encouraging"" or ""concerned with encouragement post."" On the other hand, ""uncertain in encouraging"" is too specific and doesn't cover the proactive aspect of ""avoids encouraging.""

It is broad enough to cover the concept of an extension of these terms, as suggested by ""extended on favourable terms to,"" and it also implies a duration which aligns with ""in the medium term."" The other candidate labels are either too specific or do not capture the temporal aspect as effectively. ""Beneficial Term Period"" is close but less standard in phrasing than ""favorable terms period,"" and ""extended on favourable terms to"" is too specific and implies an action rather than a period."

While ""GearedTowards"" is also a good fit, ""CustomizedFor"" may have a broader semantic coverage as it implies a more deliberate and thoughtful adaptation, which is a commonality in both original phrases.

The other two labels, ""exports change as of"" and ""exports change as of"" (which are identical), are too specific and do not capture the full spectrum of the provided phrases, such as ""export prices revised upwards"" or ""increasing concentration of export sales"".

The preposition ""of"" is more generally applicable than ""in"" when discussing the context of approximation, as it implies that something is being approximated, which is a common way to express the relationship in English. The capitalization of the first word is a stylistic choice that does not affect the semantic meaning, but it does make the label consistent with standard English titling conventions for labels or headings. The removal of pluralization in ""approximations"" to ""approximation"" is acceptable because the singular form can also imply multiple instances and is more concise."

It implies a composition that is the primary or predominant part of something, which is a commonality between the given phrases. The past tense ""consisted of"" is also implied in the present-tense phrase because it suggests a composition that could be true in the past, present, or future, thus offering broad semantic coverage."

The phrase ""cautious in drawing about"" is a bit more specific and nuanced, suggesting a careful approach to the act of drawing, but it can still fall under the broader umbrella of what is allowed in the context of sketching.

It suggests a measurement related to weekly activities, which could be in terms of time or economic transactions.

It is more descriptive and encapsulates the idea that the impairment persists even when there are factors that could potentially influence or change it.

It implies a temporal relationship that is not necessarily limited to ""shorter"" horizons, thus offering wider semantic coverage. The other two options are less clear as they include the term ""shorter horizons,"" which may not accurately represent the broader concept of events occurring within any given time period, not just shorter ones."

The phrase ""cannot be replicated without adaptation for"" implies a broader scope than just direct replication, which is captured by the term ""Replication."" It is a noun form that can easily represent the process or concept as a whole, whereas ""replicates"" is a verb that might imply a more specific action.

While ""cause of distortion"" is specific to the causation aspect, ""Interaction with Distortion"" can cover causation, being affected by distortion (as implied by ""distorted by""), and addressing or dealing with distortion (as in ""addressed distortions in""). This makes it a more flexible and general label that can be applied to various contexts within a knowledge graph."

The label ""Upbringing or Questioning"" is the only proposed label that encompasses both of these concepts, providing broad semantic coverage. ""RaisedBy"" is too narrow as it only covers the upbringing aspect, and ""RaisedTimes"" is not representative of the given phrases as it seems to imply frequency or multiplication rather than a relationship or action."

Each of the phrases implies a notable change or impact, which is captured by the word ""significant effect."" The verb ""indicates"" is a more neutral and broadly applicable term compared to ""shows hit on"" or ""shows rise in,"" which may imply specific directions of impact (negative or positive, respectively). Therefore, ""Indicates significant effect on"" is the most suitable canonical label as it covers the semantic range of the phrases without bias towards a particular kind of impact."

""Many of them"" suggests a large subset within a group, ""more than those with"" indicates a comparison where one subset is larger than another, and ""especially those with"" implies a focus on a significant subset. The chosen label is clear, has broad semantic coverage, and is generally applicable to various contexts where these phrases might be used.

The other two options are more verbose and the term ""additional"" in ""is additional return required by"" may not always apply, making ""must return"" the most clear and semantically inclusive choice."

'Decrease in' is general enough to cover various contexts where a cut or reduction is involved, yet specific enough to convey the core meaning shared by all the phrases. CESI's ""Includes cuts in"" is too specific and doesn't cover all cases, especially where there is no inclusion.

It reflects that the relations are not only about a specific rate or value in a single month (e.g., July or May) but also includes the notion of comparison between months (e.g., June to July). The phrases suggest a temporal aspect (monthly) and a focus on rates or values, which may fluctuate or be compared. The label proposed by CoT encompasses both the individual rates/values and the comparative aspect, making it the most suitable choice for representing the semantic similarity among the given phrases."

It is broad enough to encompass various contexts where a decline is initiated or caused, making it suitable for general applicability across different scenarios in a knowledge graph. The CESI label ""trigger decline in"" is also a good candidate but is slightly less concise.

The phrase ""cannot be fully reconciled with"" implies a conflict or a difficulty in making two or more aspects compatible. The label ""Functioning Conflict or Compatibility Issue"" by CoT captures the essence of both phrases by indicating there is either a conflict (something is not functioning correctly) or a compatibility issue (something cannot be reconciled with another), thus providing a broad semantic coverage that can apply to various situations where these phrases might be used.

It also implies that the payment is part of the employees' earnings, which can be inferred from the phrase ""recorded as."" The label proposed by CESI (""paid to employers"") is not representative of the group, as it suggests that employers are the recipients, which contradicts the other phrases.

The inclusion of quotation marks in CoT's suggestion (""Signaled a change in"") does not add clarity or semantic value and may imply a direct quote rather than a canonical label. The capitalization of the first word in CoT's suggestion is also unnecessary for a canonical label, which is typically in lowercase for consistency in knowledge graphs.

It is clear and concise, and it uses more formal language that is likely to be understood in a wide range of contexts. The phrase ""categories in time"" is less clear and could be interpreted in multiple ways, while ""classification time reference"" is not as succinct and could imply a reference to the time of classification rather than the classification of time-related categories. ""Time-Based Classification"" also avoids redundancy and is more indicative of a process or system, which is appropriate for a knowledge graph relation."

The other two labels are more specific and context-dependent, which limits their semantic coverage. ""Ease on account of"" implies causation, which may not apply to all phrases, and ""unlikely to ease in the near future due to"" suggests a negative prediction, which is also not universally applicable."

It suggests a broader and more inclusive concept, which is applicable to a wide range of contexts where there is a mixture or assortment of elements. While ""variety among"" is also a good fit, ""Diversity within"" seems to encapsulate the notion of a range of differences that exist within a single entity or collection, which aligns well with the semantic meaning of the original phrases."

It encompasses various types of relationships, whether they are bidirectional, historical, stable, or weak, and it implies an analysis or estimation of the relationship without limiting the nature of the connection. ""Used to estimate relationship"" is too specific, as it focuses on the action of estimating rather than the relationship itself. ""Association between"" is also a good candidate, but it may imply a more causal or correlational link, which might not apply to all the given phrases, such as ""has historical relationship presented in.""

While ""found its way to"" suggests a journey or a destination reached, ""found to be best"" implies a conclusion reached after evaluation. The suggested label ""Determined through a process"" is broad enough to encompass both the journey aspect and the evaluative conclusion, making it a more inclusive and representative label for the given phrases.

The word ""resuming"" suggests a gradual process, which is an important aspect of the second phrase. Additionally, ""normalcy"" is a more formal and encompassing term that can be applied in various contexts, making it a broadly applicable and clear canonical label.

Both of these latter phrases suggest a transformation or conversion to a different form or unit, which is a concept encapsulated by ""denominated in."" The label ""Reduced to"" proposed by CoT is less appropriate because it implies a decrease or diminishment, which is not necessarily implied by ""denominated in"" or ""shortened in.""

The other two labels, ""consumption of"" and ""noted consumption shifts,"" are more limited in scope. ""Consumption of"" is too narrow, focusing only on the act of consuming, while ""noted consumption shifts"" implies a change in consumption patterns without capturing the full range of influences and impacts.

While ""hints at"" could be seen as a more passive form of effort, it still implies a direction towards an outcome or understanding, which can be seen as an effort to convey or achieve something. ""Help"" and ""attempt at"" are more directly associated with making an effort. Therefore, ""Effort"" is the most broadly applicable label that captures the essence of all three phrases."

It is clear and concise, and it can be broadly applied to various contexts where one group is the predominant holder of something, whether it be power, shares, space, or another resource. It also avoids the specific action implied by ""resulted in,"" making it more generally applicable to situations where the majority status may not be the direct result of an event, which aligns with the more passive phrase ""predominantly took up."""

- rebuilding is crucial for",should be rebuilt to help cover,"""Reconstruction is necessary for support""",should be rebuilt to help cover,"""Reconstruction is necessary for support""",CoT,"The phrase ""Reconstruction is necessary for support"" captures the essence of both given phrases by emphasizing the necessity of rebuilding for the purpose of providing support, which is a broader and more general concept. It abstracts the idea of rebuilding being crucial without limiting the context to a specific way of helping or covering, thus offering a more inclusive representation of the semantic meaning shared by the original phrases. The other two options are identical and more specific in their wording, which could restrict their applicability in a knowledge graph where broader relation phrases are often more useful for linking diverse concepts."

- adopted over time period
- adoption year
- agree on adopting",adopted over time period,"""Adoption Timeline""",has considerable variation in adoption across,"""Adoption Timeline""",CoT,"The label ""Adoption Timeline"" encompasses the concept of adoption occurring over a period of time, which is a common theme in all the given phrases. It implies a chronological sequence, which is relevant to the notion of something being ""adopted over time period"" and having ""adoption year."" Additionally, the idea of ""considerable variation in adoption across"" different times or contexts also fits within the timeline concept, as it suggests a tracking of adoption rates or practices over time. The label ""Adoption Timeline"" is clear, concise, and has the broadest semantic coverage, making it the most suitable canonical label for representing all the given phrases."

- has uncertainty regarding",has uncertainty regarding,"""Causes or Experiences Uncertainty""",become more uncertain due to,"""Causes or Experiences Uncertainty""",CoT,"The label ""Causes or Experiences Uncertainty"" is the most inclusive and accurately captures the essence of all the given phrases. It covers both the causative aspect (e.g., ""causes uncertainty about,"" ""leads to uncertainty,"" ""created uncertainty"") and the state of being (e.g., ""has uncertainty,"" ""associated with uncertainty,"" ""noted as uncertainty""). The other two options are too specific and do not encompass the full range of the provided phrases. ""Become more uncertain due to"" focuses only on the process of becoming uncertain, while ""has uncertainty regarding"" is limited to possessing uncertainty about something specific. Therefore, the first label is the best choice for its clarity, broad semantic coverage, and general applicability."

It is clear and provides a broad semantic coverage that includes the process of vaccination and its subsequent effects, which aligns with the second phrase ""vaccination progress affects recovery in."" The labels ""vaccinated"" and ""vaccinated"" provided by EDC and CESI are too narrow and only reflect the state of being vaccinated, without capturing the broader context implied by the second phrase."

It is broad enough to cover instances where countries are excluded or where multiple countries are applied or covered, as well as instances where the relationship to the country is a matter of importance or coverage.

The other two labels proposed by EDC and CESI are identical and focus solely on the ""significant increase"" aspect, which does not fully capture the idea of ""impact"" that is present in the third phrase.
